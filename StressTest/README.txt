Simple webapp stress tester.

To build, it needs Jetty, but it will run in any reasonable webapp
container. The JETTY_HOME environment variable needs to be set.

Deploy the stresstest.war file normally (created in the parent
directory).

To run the client, use the stresstest.war as a jar:

  java -jar stresstest.war
