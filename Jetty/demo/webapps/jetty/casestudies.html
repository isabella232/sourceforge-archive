<H1>Jetty Case Studies</H1>

Jetty is used in an enormous variety of applications as the <a href="http://www.mortbay.com/mortbay/powered.html">Jetty Powered</a> &quot;hall-of-fame&quot; attests.

<p>Building on that, we'd like to provide a forum for the Jetty community to share more information about 
Jetty's diverse uses, and maybe even inspire some new ideas!

<p>So, we are putting together
a series of articles that will focus in-depth on a new, interesting or innovative use of Jetty.
<P>
We'll feature one article per month on the Jetty website, with a prominent link to it from the Jetty home page. 
All past articles will also be available from the site on these Case Study pages. Eventually, once there's a substantial catalogue of articles, we'll index them with a search engine.
<P>
So, if you'd like to contribute an article about some aspect of your particular application of Jetty, <a href="mailto:mortbay@mortbay.com">email</a> us with an outline. The brief for the article is fairly wide-ranging, but if you're not sure if your idea is appropriate, please <a href="mailto:mortbay@mortbay.com">email</a> us anyway to discuss it.
