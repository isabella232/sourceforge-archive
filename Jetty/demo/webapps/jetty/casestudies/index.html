When I was systems administrator for the University of North Carolina at
Charlotte department of Computer Science, I saw the need to establish an
environment for our students to experiment with servlets.
The goal was to provide a centralized system for our students to
deploy their servlets / web-applications on without having to shoulder
the additional burden of administrating their own web / servlet containers.
I developed a workable solution with Jetty version 3. I found the internal
architecture of Jetty to follow the 'as simple as things should be, but
no simpler' rule, allowing me, a time-constrained sys admin with Java
skills to squeeze off the project in the time allowed so that courses could
begin to utilize the service. Jetty's native extensibility allowed me
to easily extend its functionality to allow the students to remote-deploy
and administrate their own servlet / JSP code on the machine via webspace
gestures to the machine itself.

Jetty is used in an enormous variety of applications as the <a href="http://www.mortbay.com/mortbay/powered.html">Jetty Powered</a> &quot;hall-of-fame&quot; attests.

Building on that, we're providing a forum for the Jetty community to 
share more information about Jetty's diverse uses, maybe inspire some new ideas, and shine the PR spotlight on worthy projects and products.  

The forum is in the form of articles submitted by users focussing on their interesting or innovative use of Jetty. We feature approximately one article per month on the Jetty website, with a prominent link to it from the Jetty home page.

<P>
So, if you'd like to contribute an article about your particular application of Jetty, <a href="submission.html">contact us</a> us with an outline. The brief for the article is fairly wide-ranging, but if you're not sure if your idea is appropriate, <a href="mailto:casestudy@mortbay.com">email</a> us to discuss it.
