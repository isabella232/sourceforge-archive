QUESTION: Can Jetty reload servlets?
Jetty no longer supports automatic reloading of Servlets.  With the current complexities of 
the servlet container, it is no longer feasible to reload without doing a complete 
passivation and reactivation of the context.
<P>
Note that a context (webapplication or HttpContext) may be stopped and restarted without
restarting the whole server.  The API, admin servlet or JMX interface can be used to 
stop and restart a context, which will force a reload of all servlets in that context.
<P>
It is also possible to have a second context mapped to the same context path.  The 
second context can handle the requests while the main context is being restarted.  This
allows &quote;Under Maintenance&quote; style pages to be displayed during the restart.
<P>
For development mode, you can run Jetty as a normal application in any IDE that supports
class reloading.   Also there now is a i
<a href="http://jetty.mortbay.org/jetty6/maven-plugin/index.html">Jetty 6 plugin</a>
for <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">maven2 </a> users that will
run a webapplication and automatically hot redploy if anything changes.
