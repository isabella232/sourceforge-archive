<h2>Development Series: 5.1.x</h2>
Jetty is currently being J2EE certified as part of the Apache Geronimo project. The
5.1.x/HEAD  branch of Jetty contains the compliance changes as well as some optimizations
inspired by the JettyExperimental branch. The code for 5.1 is in 
<a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/jetty/Jetty/">CVS HEAD</a>. 

<H2>Stable Series: Jetty 5.0.x</H2>
The 5.0.0 release in September 2004 was an evolution of the jetty 4 series to support
the 2.4 Servlet specification.  This is now the stable release.

The code of 5.0.0 is in the <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/jetty/Jetty/?only_with_tag=Jetty_5_0_0">Jetty_5_0_0 tag of CVS</a>.


<H2>Solid Series: Jetty 4.2.x</H2>

Jetty 4.2 is the stable release for the 2.3 servlet specification.  It has been stable
since November 2002. Development is continuing on this series for maintenance, 
increased integration and extensions such as:<UL>
<LI>JBoss integration.
<LI>Jonas integration.
<LI>JMX extension.
<LI>JettyPlus JNDI and JOTM integration.
</UL>

The code of 4.2.x is in the <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/jetty/Jetty/?only_with_tag=Jetty_4_2">Jetty_4_2 branch of CVS</a>.

<H2>Experimental Series </H2>
The <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/jetty/JettyExperimental/">JettyExperimental CVS</a>
contains experimental code for a new HTTP layer for Jetty.  The code is close to providing
a fully HTTP/1.1 compliant stack meeting the following aims:
<ul>
<li>Flyweight. The code has been stripped down to just support the core HTTP/1.1</li>
<li>Improved buffering for performance, minimal footprint and portability. NIO direct buffers 
will be able to be used where available.</li>
<li>It is blocking-agnostic, so that NIO non-blocking semantics can be used when
the application layer supports it</li> 
<li>Highly portable. It is intended for the stack to be able to run on anything from 
a PDA to the latest greatest version of JRE on a SMP</li>
</ul>
<p>
The HTTP stack is currently working well with NIO and BIO.  Work is continuing through
Q4 2004 on experimental APIs.
