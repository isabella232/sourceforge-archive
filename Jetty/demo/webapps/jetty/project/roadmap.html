<H2>Stable Series: Jetty 4.2.x</H2>

This is the current stable series of Jetty since November 2002. Development is 
continuing on this series for stability, increased integration and extensions such as:<UL>
<LI>JBoss integration.
<LI>Jonas integration.
<LI>JMX extension.
<LI>JettyPlus JNDI and JOTM integration.
</UL>

The code of 4.2.x is in the <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/jetty/Jetty/?only_with_tag=Jetty_4_2">Jetty_4_2 branch of CVS</a>.

<H2>Development Series: Jetty 5.0.x</H2>
The servlet specication 2.4 will final in Q4 2003.  The 2.4 spec is
pretty incremental on the 2.3 spec, so this will be an evolution rather than
revolution.  The Jetty 5 series is an moderate increment of the 4.2 series, which
already had much of the required infrastructure for the 2.4 specification.
This will allow a stable Jetty 5.0 to be release soon after the final specification.
<p>
Jetty 5.0 is currently in alpha release and the latest code is available
in the <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/jetty/Jetty/">CVS HEAD</a>. 

<H2>Experimental Series </H2>
The <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/jetty/JettyExperimental/">JettyExperimental CVS</a>
contains experimental code for a new HTTP layer for Jetty.  The code is close to providing
a fully HTTP/1.1 compliant stack meeting the following aims:
<ul>
<li>Flyweight. The code has been stripped down to just support the core HTTP/1.1</li>
<li>Improved buffering for performance, minimal footprint and portability. NIO direct buffers 
will be able to be used where available.</li>
<li>It is blocking-agnostic, so that NIO non-blocking semantics can be used when
the application layer supports it</li> 
<li>Highly portable. It is intended for the stack to be able to run on anything from 
a PDA to the latest greatest version of JRE on a SMP</li>
</ul>
<p>
The code is close to a first release of a HTTP stack in Q4 2003.
Only once the HTTP stack is stable and tested, will servlets be considered
for main release. Jetty 5.1 is the likely target in Q1 2004.
