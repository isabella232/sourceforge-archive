<H2>Can Jetty use JDK 1.4 features?</H2>

Jetty can use JDK 1.4 features such as logging and non blocking IO.
The src1.4 directory is optionally compiled if a 1.4 javac is detected.
<P>
Currently the 1.4 features used include:<UL>
<LI>The org.mortbay.http.SocketChannelListener class uses the java.nio package
for nonblocking IO for accepting connections and monitoring idle connections.  
A thread is only allocated to a connection to perform blocking IO when a request
is actively being handled.

<LI>The org.mortbay.util.Frame class replaces the 1.2 version with a more efficient
handling of the stack frame for debugging.

<LI>The org.mortbay.util.LoggerLogSink class sends Jetty logging data to the 1.4 log mechanism
</UL>
