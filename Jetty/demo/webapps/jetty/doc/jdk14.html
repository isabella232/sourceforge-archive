<H2>Can Jetty use JDK 1.4 features?</H2>

Jetty is compiled by default to use JDK 1.4 features. The extras/jdk1.2
directory provides alternatives source for java &lt; jdk1.4/

<P>
Currently the 1.4 features used include:<UL>
<LI>The org.mortbay.http.SocketChannelListener class uses the java.nio package
for nonblocking IO for accepting connections and monitoring idle connections.  
A thread is only allocated to a connection to perform blocking IO when a request
is actively being handled.  This has not proved to be of any significant
benefit as the constantly changing SelectSets stress the current generations
of JVMs.  It has currently been deprecated.

<LI>The org.mortbay.util.Frame class replaces the 1.2 version with a more efficient
handling of the stack frame for debugging.

<LI>The org.mortbay.util.LoggerLogSink class sends Jetty logging data to the 1.4 log mechanism
</UL>
