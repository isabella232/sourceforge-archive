<H2>Is Jetty Compatible with Tomcat?</H2>
<B>YES!</B>
<P>
Jetty is implemented to the same servlet specification to tomcat 3.x and
accepts the same web application configuration files.  For JSP, jetty
uses the jasper code from the Jakarta project.
<P>
Jetty is tested against the Jakarta watchdog servlet test suite and
currently passes 205 and fails 3 tests.   The 3 failed tests are
probably due to errors in the watchdog suite against the spec:
<P>
<B>Get Context Test</B>: This test fails as watchdog attempts to get
a context using a path within the context, rather than an absolute context.
The specification clearly states that the URI should be absolute.
<P>
<B>Get Request Dispatcher Test</B>: This test fails due to an apparent
naming error in watchdog, where 'Test' has been left off the URI of
the requested dispatcher.
<P>
<B>Get Path Translated Test</B>: This test fails as Jetty runs WAR files
in a packed form, thus there are no file paths available. 
The getResource API work for compressed WAR files.   If the WAR file
is unpacked, Jetty passes this test.
<P>
The Jetty server itself is configured differently to tomcat, so it
does not accept tomcat server.xml files.
