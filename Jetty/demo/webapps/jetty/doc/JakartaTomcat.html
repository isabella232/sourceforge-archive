<BR><B><FONT SIZE="+2">How does Jetty relate to Jakarta Tomcat</FONT></B><HR>
<BR><BR>
<A HREF=http://jakarta.apache.org>Jakarta Tomcat</A> is the apache/Sun effort
to produce a reference implementation of the Servlet API.  The Tomcat project
is the merge of the apache JSERV container and Sun's original reference
implementation.
<BR><BR>
Tomcat is primarily a <A HREF="ServletContainer.html">ServletContainer</A> that can be used by 
various HTTP servers, normally as a separate process.  It does contain
a Java HTTP server, but it is only a simple implementation.
Tomcat is part of the Jakarta project and forms an element within
a larger framework. 
<BR><BR>
Jetty is both a HTTP server and a <A HREF="ServletContainer.html">ServletContainer</A>, in a single JVM.
The focus of Jetty is to provide a full featured implementation of
the HTTP/1.1 protocol and a standards compliant <A HREF="ServletContainer.html">ServletContainer</A>.
<BR><BR>
Jetty is intended to be deployable as a complete HTTP/Servlet 
component within a Java application.
<BR><BR>
The different focus of Jetty allows it be smaller, faster, simpler
and more flexible than Tomcat. 
<BR><BR>
Jetty uses the jasper JSP engine from the jakarta project.
