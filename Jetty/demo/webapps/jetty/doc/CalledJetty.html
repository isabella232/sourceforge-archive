<H2>So why is it called Jetty?</H2>
<P>
Jetty was originally developed by Greg Wilkins&nbsp; of <A HREF="http://www.mortbay.com">Mort Bay Consulting.</A>
<P>
Mort Bay is at the heart of Balmain, Sydney NSW, Australia.  A former working class suburb, now yuppieville in Sydney's close inner-west.  Each weekend thousands (ok, maybe hundreds) flock to the ever growing cafe atmosphere.
<P>
Greg  was living by Mort Bay when the company was formed, hence the company name.
<P>
Jetty was originally called IssueTracker (its original application) and 
then MBServler (Mort Bay SERVLet servER).   Neither of these were much liked,
so Jetty was finally picked as it started with a J, jetty: looks a little like http:
and there is a jetty in the Mort Bay Logo:
