<BR><B><FONT SIZE="+2">So why is it called Jetty?</FONT></B><HR>
Jetty was originally developed by GregWilkins&nbsp;<!-- widget ref --> of Mort Bay Consulting.
<BR><BR>
Mort Bay is at the heart of Balmain, Sydney NSW, Australia.  A former working class suburb, now yuppieville in Sydney's close inner-west.  Each weekend thousands (ok, maybe hundreds) flock to the ever growing cafe atmosphere.
<BR><BR>
GregWilkins&nbsp;<!-- widget ref --> was living by Mort Bay when the company was formed, hence
the company name.
<BR><BR>
Jetty was originally called IssueTracker&nbsp;<!-- widget ref -->(its original application) and 
then MBServler (Mort Bay SERVLet servER).   They suxed as names,
so we changed to Jetty - which also sux, but it starts with a J for
java and there is a little jetty in the mortbay logo.
<BR><BR>
This explains the logo.
