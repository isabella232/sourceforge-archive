<H2>Where are Jetty's temporary directories?</H2>
Jetty itself has no temporary directories, but each web application can be assigned
a temporary directory. If the web application is a WAR file, it may be unpacked to the 
webapp directory within the web applications temporary directory.
<p>
When assigning a temporary directory to a webapplication the following
locations are considered: <ul>

<li>The javax.servlet.context.tempdir attribute of the web application is check
to see if a directory name or a File has already been set.</li>

<li>If a WEB-INF/work directory exists, it is used directly.</li>

<li>If a ${jetty.home}/work directory exists, then a temp directory 
is created within that directory.</li>

<li>If no other location has been found, a temporary directory
is created within the ${java.io.tempdir} directory.

</ul>
<p>
If a temporary directory is created, it is given a name based on
the first HttpListener within the HttpServer as follows:
"jetty_" + listener.getHost() + "_" + listener.getPort() + "_" + virtualHost + "_" + contextPath
<p>
Directories created within the java.io.tempdir are marked as deleteOnExit and
are not reused between invocations of the web application context.
<p>
Once a tempory directory has been allocated, a File instance for it
is set as the javax.servlet.context.tempdir attribute of the web
application.
