<BR><B><FONT SIZE="+2">Can Jetty be integrated with JBoss or other J2EE
servers?</FONT></B><HR>
Yes! 
<BR><BR>
Jetty has been integrated with <A HREF="http://www.jboss.org">JBoss</A>, one
of the leading J2EE implementations, to provide a fully open source J2EE
solution. In fact, as of <A HREF="http://www.jboss.org/binary.jsp">JBoss 3.0</A>, Jetty is the defacto standard web container shipped with JBoss releases. Jetty
developers continue to work closely with JBoss to maintain a tight integration. <BR><BR>
Links to the <A HREF="http://www.jboss.org/binary.jsp"> latest Jetty/JBoss release</A> can be found on the JBoss site.
<BR><BR>
There is also an <b>outdated</b> (but soon to be updated)<A HREF="http://www.jboss.org/developers/projects/jboss/jetty.jsp"> overview of using Jetty in JBoss</A> available.
<BR><BR>
Whilst Jetty developers are not currently actively involved in integrating Jetty with other J2EE implementations, others in the open source community could well be. If you are, or you know of such a project, please <A
