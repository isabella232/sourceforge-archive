<H2>Why do I see my JSP/webmacro etc source?</H2>

There is a common type of misconfiguration of Jetty that will often
result in the source of a JSP, webmacro or other dynamic page
being served rather than the generated content from that page.
<P>
In Jetty, HttpHandlers are order dependant and requests are passed
to the handlers in the order they were defined.   Thus if a ResourceHandler
is defined with:<PRE>
  context.setServingResources(true);
</PRE>
or <PRE>
  context.addHandler(new ResourceHandler());
</PRE>
before a servlet or other dynamic content handler has been added and/or
configured, then the ResourceHandler will server the source of the
JSPs, webmacros, etc. before the servlet can be invoked.
