<BR><BR>
Firstly remember that Jetty is a HTTP/1.1 server and there is no need to use another webserver
just to serve static content.  However, if existing applications or special features require IIS 
to be used, it is possible to use Jetty behind IIS.
<P>
The apache mod_jk connector is available for IIS and is documented <A href=modjk.html>here</A>.
<P>
The <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/iisrelayj/">IISRelayJ</A> project produces a DLL 
that allows IIS to forward requests to Jetty.
