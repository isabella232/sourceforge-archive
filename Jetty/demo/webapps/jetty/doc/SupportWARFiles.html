<BR><B><FONT SIZE="+2">Does Jetty Support WAR files?</FONT></B><HR>
Jetty supports Web Applications as WAR files and can run most features without
unpacking the WAR file.
<BR><BR>
If the WAR file contains jars or zips, these are extracted to
temporary locations.
<BR><BR>
If the WAR file contains JSPs which are compiled against
classes also in the WAR file, then compilation fails as the
java compiler cannot handle URL classpaths (eg jar:file:/my.war!/WEB-INF/classes).   
In this situation, the user should unpack the war file manually or during deployment.
