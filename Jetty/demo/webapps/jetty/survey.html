<H1>Jetty Survey</H1>

The Jetty community is interested in how Jetty is being used. We already know that there is a huge variety of <a href="http://www.mortbay.com/mortbay/powered.html">Jetty Powered</a> applications out there.  We've recently started to look at some of them <a href="casestudies.html">in depth </a> as case studies of innovative applications, interesting techniques etc.

<P>We'd also like to take a look at Jetty on the macro scale, for example: 
<ul>
  <li>How many projects/products use Jetty embedded vs standalone vs as part of a J2EE app server?
  <li>How frequently is Jetty deployed on mainframe/Linux/Windows platforms?
  <li>What is the JDK most frequently used with Jetty?
  <li>Which version of Jetty is currently the most widely used?
</ul>

<P>If you have a few moments spare, you can contribute to the Jetty community's knowledge base by <a href="mailto:mortbay@mortbay.com">sending us an email</a>.
