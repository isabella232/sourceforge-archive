<P>
<H1>Jetty Project</H1>

The Jetty Projects primary focus is on providing a high quality 100% java
HTTP Server and Servlet container.  While Jetty can be used stand-alone, the
project is not attempting to provide a full application server.
Instead our approach is to develop Jetty as a component that can be used
within other project/products to provide HTTP and/or servlets.
<P>
This component focus allows us to stay on target with the development of the
following packages:
<UL>
<TABLE border=0>

<TR>
<TD><B><A HREF="/javadoc/org/mortbay/jetty/servlet/package-summary.html">org.mortbay.jetty.servlet</A></B></TD>
<TD>-</TD><TD>The J2EE Servlet container</TD>

<TR>
<TD><B><A HREF="/javadoc/org/mortbay/http/package-summary.html">org.mortbay.http</A></B></TD>
<TD>-</TD><TD>The HTTP/1.1 protocol stack</TD>

<TR>
<TD><B><A HREF="/javadoc/org/mortbay/util/package-summary.html">org.mortbay.util</A></B></TD>
<TD>-</TD><TD>Utilities for the above.</TD>

</TABLE>
</UL>
The way these packages interact is documented in the 
<A href="/jetty/tut/index.html">Jetty Tutorial</A> and 
<A href="/jetty/doc/index.html">FAQ</A>.
JSP is not part of the
Jetty project and the Jasper JSP engine from <a
href="http://jakarta.apache.org">Jakarta</a> is used.
<p>
In the Jetty distribution, the main source tree ( <code>$JETTY_HOME/src</code> ) contains
the code for the core Jetty project. The extensions to Jetty that are
included with the distribution are found in the extra tree (
<code>$JETTY_HOME/extra</code>) and are briefly described on the <A
href="../projects.html">project page</a>.  Many of the projects and products
that extend the core Jetty functionality are listed on the <A
href="http://www.mortbay.com/mortbay/powered.html">Jetty Powered</A> page.
