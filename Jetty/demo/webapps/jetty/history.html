<h1>Jetty History</h1>

Jetty was originally written by Greg Wilkins, founder of <A
HREF="http://www.mortbay.com">Mort Bay Consulting Australia and UK</A>, in
1995 as an entry in the Sun Microsystems Australia Java programming
competition, which it won. In 1998, Jetty became fully open source and <b>freely available</b> for <A
HREF="/jetty/download.html">download</A>, use and modification in accordance
with the terms of its <A HREF="/jetty/LICENSE.html">license</A>.  
<P>Greg and
other Mort Bay consultants continue to be the prime developers of Jetty,
however we recognise the invaluable contributions of the open source community
in the form of feedback, testing and patches and we invite you to <A
HREF="/jetty/contributing.html">take part</A>.

<P>
<B>October 1998.</B> Jetty 2.0 released with HTTP/1.1 support.
<P>
<B>December 1997.</B> Jetty development finally progressed to a Release 1.0
stage.  The package hierarchy was moved to a org.mortbay structure and
merged with the other software packages of Mort Bay Consulting.
The JSDK versions of the javax.servlets were included in the release
in accordance with JavaSoft licensing requirements.
<p>
<B>February 1997.</B> All involved agreed that MBServler was a terrible name,
so many weeks of effort were put in to remove all references to that name.
In the process the HttpHandler architecture was developed and support for
the beta1.0 javax.servlet API added.  Jetty was picked as the new
name, as it started with a J and there is a little jetty in the Mort
Bay Logo.  You can supply your own subtitles along the lines of "Jetty -
dock your applications to the Web".
<p>
<B>December 1996.</B> The HTML generation package was used re-implemented and
documented. Release V4.5B of MBServler and IssueTracker were made
available.
<p>
<B>May 1996.</B>
Mort Bay entered a partnership with
<A href=http://www.iswitched.com>Intelligent Switched Systems</A>
to develop telephony and WWW based authenticated service platforms.
MBServler is used extensively in those platforms and was incrementally
improved by the process.
<p>
<B>March 1996.</B>
<A href=http://www.mortbay.com>Mort Bay Consulting Pty. Ltd.</A>
took over the server and tracking application.  The server was
renamed MBServler (a Servlet Serving Server) and ported to
the then release alpha javax.servlet API.
<p>
<B>December 1995.</B>
<A href=http://www.mortbay.com/people/gregw>Greg Wilkins</A>
wrote a HTTP Server and WWW defect tracking
application as an entry to the Sun Microsystems Australia Java programming
contest.  Greg's entry won the contest.  This pre-dated Javasoft's
announcement of Jeeves and the javax.servlet API, so the server defined
its own API.
