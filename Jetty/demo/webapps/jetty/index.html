<A NAME="Java"></A>
<H3>100% Java Server</H3>  
Jetty is a 100% Java HTTP Server and Servlet Container.  This means that you do not need to configure and run a seperate web server (like apache) in order to use java, servlets and JSPs to generate dynamic content.   Jetty is a fully featured web server for static and dynamic content.
<p>
Unlike separate server/container solutions, this means that your web server and web application run in the same process, without interconnection overheads and complications. Furthermore, as a pure java component, Jetty can be simply included in your application for demonstration, distribution or deployment. Jetty is available on all Java supported platforms.

<A NAME="Open"></A>
<H3>Open Source License</H3>
Jetty is released under an <A HREF="http://www.opensource.org">Open Source</A>
License, derived from the Artistic License. Full source code is included in
the release. <B><A HREF=/jetty/LICENSE.html>The License</A></B> puts few restrictions on usage of Jetty, which is free for commercial use and distribution.
<P>

free software is under threat.

<A NAME="HTTP11"></A>
<BR>&nbsp;<H3>HTTP/1.1 Protocol</H3>
Jetty supports the HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1 protocols. The 1.1 protocol offers
much greater network performance.  Furthermore, as the HTTP server and the
Servlet container and in the same JVM, this gives simpler configuration, 
much greater performance and full access to all server resources from 
within servlets.

<A NAME="Servlets"></A>
<BR>&nbsp;<H3>Serving Servlets</H3>
Jetty supports the javax.servlet. API defined by
<A HREF=http://www.javasoft.com>JavaSoft</A>:
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>
Servlets are protocol- and platform-independent server side components,
written in Java, which dynamically extend Java-enabled
servers. They provide a general framework for services built using the
request-response paradigm. </I> [Javasoft's Java Servlet API White Paper]
</BLOCKQUOTE>
There are versions of Jetty for all versions of the servlet spec.  The latest
2.3 spec is supported by the Jetty4 releases.

<A NAME="JSP"></A>
<BR>&nbsp;<H3>Java Server Pages</H3>
Jetty includes a JSP package, which implements Java Server Pages, a method
for adding dynamic content to HTML pages. Currently this is the Jasper JSP
engine from apache.

<A NAME="SSL"></A>
<BR>&nbsp;<H3>SSL Support</H3>
Jetty has a <A HREF="/jetty/JsseSSL.html">SunJsseListener</A> which uses Sun's JSSE reference implementation to provide support for HTTPS. It is even possible to use the same pair of public/private keys as a pre-existing apache server by using the KeyPairTool to load the private key and its certificate into a keystore for JSSE.

<p> If the use of a commercial SSL implementation is required, <A HREF=http://www.forge.com.au>FORGE</A> have contributed a listener which allows their Protekt product to be used as an SSL provider. A similar approach may be used to integrate other SSL implementations.

<A NAME="Modular"></A>
<BR>&nbsp;<H3>Modular Architecture</H3>
Jetty request handling is based on collections of abstracted request listeners
and handlers. All Jetty features are provided by specializations of these
abstract components.   This allows Jetty's behaviour to be extended and/or
enhanced by the addition of extra listeners and handlers.
<P>
The <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=7322">Jetty3xtra</A> repository contains extension such as JMX configuration and SASL authentication. 

<A NAME="Embeddable"></A>
<BR>&nbsp;<H3>Embeddable</H3>
For many applications, HTTP is just another interface protocol. Jetty can
easily be embedded in such applications and products without adopting a 
WWW centric application architecture. A good example of this style of usage
is in a distributed system, where each process runs it's own Jetty server
in order to present a managment and monitoring Web interface. 

<A NAME="Efficient"></A>
<BR>&nbsp;<H3>Small & Efficient</H3>
Jetty has been optimized by commercial and experimental use since 1995 and
a small and efficient server is the result: <UL>
  <LI>A HTTP server can be configured in a jar file under 200KB.
  <LI>Jetty consistently benchmarks as one of the fastest servlet servers.
  <LI>Jetty servers scale well to thousands of simultaneous connections
  <LI>Server performance degrades gracefully under stress.
</UL>

<A NAME="Config"></A>
<H3>Flexible Configuration</H3>       
Jetty has been designed to highly configurable and flexible. It can be used
as a stand-alone server running application servlets or it can be embedded
in java application to provide a WWW interface to the services that they
provide.  The configuration of a server is controlled by:<UL>
  <LI>J2EE deployment descriptors.
  <LI>Direct API calls.
  <LI>XML configuration.
</UL>

<A NAME="HTML"></A>
<H3>HTML Generation</H3>
While HTML is a simple language to learn and write, it can be also be
very tedious, contrived and error prone.  Furthermore, authored HTML
is a static resource and cannot be customized to each request or updated
from a database.
<P>
Jetty comes with a rich HTML generation package that can be used on its
own, with another servlet server or in Jetty servlets. Supported for
templated look and feel is a key element of this package.

<A NAME="EJB"></A>
<BR>&nbsp;<H3>EJB Integration</H3>
Jetty has been instrumented as JMX model MBeans which allows it
to be seamlessly integrated into the <A HREF="http://www.jboss.org">JBoss</A> EJB 
application server. This gives a complete J2EE container with 
HTTP, Servlets, JSPs and EJBs all within a single JVM.
