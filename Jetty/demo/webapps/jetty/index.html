<H1>Jetty:// Java HTTP Server &amp; Servlet Container</H1>

<B>Jetty</b> is a 100% Java HTTP Server and Servlet Container.  This means
that you do not need to configure and run a seperate web server (like Apache)
in order to use java, servlets and JSPs to generate dynamic content. Jetty
is a fully featured web server for static and dynamic content. Unlike separate
server/container solutions, this means that your web server and web application
run in the same process, without interconnection overheads and complications.
Furthermore, as a pure java component, Jetty can be simply included in your
application for demonstration, distriybution or deployment. Jetty is available
on all Java supported platforms. &nbsp;</p>

Jetty has been optimized by commercial and experimental use since 1995 and
a small and efficient server is the result: <ul><li>A HTTP/1.1 server can be configured in a jar file under 300KB.
</li><li>Jetty consistently benchmarks as one of the fastest servlet servers.
</li><li>Jetty servers scale well to thousands of simultaneous connections
</li><li>Server performance degrades gracefully under stress.</li></ul>

Jetty has been widely used in commercial and open source
projects and applications, ranging across the full spectrum of runtime environments
from hand helds to main frames. To illustrate this diversity, we have put
together a (far from exhaustive) <a href="http://www.mortbay.com/mortbay/powered.html">list of Jetty Powered products</a>. Here
are just a few of highlights:
<ul>
<li>Used as the default servlet container in the <a
href="http://www.jboss.org/">JBoss</a> and integrated with <a
href="http://www.objectweb.org/jonas/index.html">JOnAS</a> J2EE application servers.
</li><li>
Bundled with the <a href="http://www.jxta.org/">JXTA</a>, <a
href="http://tapestry.sourceforge.net">Tapestry</a>,
<a href="http://xml.apache.org/cocoon/">Cocoon</a> and other Open Source projects.
</li><li>Integrated projects such as 
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/sandbox/jelly/">Jelly executable XML</a>,
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/avalon/phoenix/index.html">Avalon Phoenix
micro kernel</a>
and
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/turbine/maven/">Maven project managment</a>
</li><li>Included in many products including IBM Tivoli, Sonic MQ and
Cisco SESM.
</li>
</ul>

For many applications, HTTP is just another interface protocol. Jetty can
easily be embedded in such applications and products without adopting a 
WWW centric application architecture. Examples of embedded Jetty usage include:<ul><li>Integration into application servers such as  <a href="http://www.jboss.org/">JBoss</a> and <a href="http://www.objectweb.org/jonas/">Jonas</a>.
</li><li>Bundled with the <a href="http://www.jxta.org/">JXTA</a> project as the
basis for its HTTP transport.
</li><li>Included in many products products including IBM tivolli, Sonic MQ and
Cisco SESM.
</li><li>Used for the CD demo disk in several books on XML and Servlets.
</li><li>Run on embedded systems and handheld devices.
