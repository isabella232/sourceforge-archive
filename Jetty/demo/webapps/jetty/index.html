It was originally written by Greg Wilkins, founder of <A
HREF="http://www.mortbay.com">Mort Bay Consulting Australia and UK</A>, in
1995. In 1998, Jetty became open source and is <b>freely available</b> for <A

with the terms of its <A HREF="/jetty/LICENSE.html">license</A>.  Greg and
other Mort Bay consultants continue to be the prime developers of Jetty,
however we recognise the invaluable contributions of the open source community
in the form of feedback, testing and patches and we invite you to <A

<p>
This site provides a number of <A HREF="/jetty/resources.html">sources of information</A> on Jetty, ranging from tutorials and FAQs through to Javadoc on the Jetty source. Further assistance
is available on the <A HREF="/jetty/mailingLists.html">mailing-lists</A>. Full <A HREF="/jetty/support.html">professional consulting and support services</A>

Mort Bay Consulting is also affiliated with <A HREF="http://www.jbossgroup.com">JBoss Group</A>,
the originators of <A HREF="http://www.jboss.org">JBoss</A>, the popular open source J2EE application server.  A product of this affiliation has been the integration of Jetty as the standard servlet container for JBoss, providing a powerful
 and complete <A

Mort Bay extends its professional support services to the Jetty/JBoss
environment and JBoss in general.

<H2> Features </H2>
<P>
<A NAME="Java"></A>
<H3>100% Java Server</H3>  
Jetty is a 100% Java HTTP Server and Servlet Container.  This means that you do not need to configure and run a seperate web server (like apache) in order to use java, servlets and JSPs to generate dynamic content.   Jetty is a fully featured web server for static and dynamic content.
<p>
Unlike separate server/container solutions, this means that your web server and web application run in the same process, without interconnection overheads and complications. Furthermore, as a pure java component, Jetty can be simply included in your application for demonstration, distribution or deployment. Jetty is available on all Java supported platforms.

<A NAME="Open"></A>
<H3>Open Source License</H3>
Jetty is released under an <A HREF="http://www.opensource.org">Open Source</A>
License, derived from the Artistic License. Full source code is included in
the release. <B><A HREF=/jetty/LICENSE.html>The License</A></B> puts few restrictions on usage of Jetty, which is free for commercial use and distribution.
<P>
Please read the <A HREF="/jetty/freesoftware.html">Free Software</A> page to learn about how
free software is under threat.

<A NAME="HTTP11"></A>
<BR>&nbsp;<H3>HTTP/1.1 Protocol</H3>
Jetty supports the HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1 protocols. The 1.1 protocol offers
much greater network performance.  Furthermore, as the HTTP server and the
Servlet container and in the same JVM, this gives simpler configuration, 
much greater performance and full access to all server resources from 
within servlets.

<A NAME="Servlets"></A>
<BR>&nbsp;<H3>Serving Servlets</H3>
Jetty supports the javax.servlet. API defined by
<A HREF=http://www.javasoft.com>JavaSoft</A>:
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>
Servlets are protocol- and platform-independent server side components,
written in Java, which dynamically extend Java-enabled
servers. They provide a general framework for services built using the
request-response paradigm. </I> [Javasoft's Java Servlet API White Paper]
</BLOCKQUOTE>
There are versions of Jetty for all versions of the servlet spec.  The latest
2.3 spec is supported by the Jetty4 releases.

<A NAME="JSP"></A>
<BR>&nbsp;<H3>Java Server Pages</H3>
Jetty includes a JSP package, which implements Java Server Pages, a method
for adding dynamic content to HTML pages. Currently this is the Jasper JSP
engine from apache.

<A NAME="SSL"></A>
<BR>&nbsp;<H3>SSL Support</H3>
Jetty has a <A HREF="/jetty/JsseSSL.html">SunJsseListener</A> which uses Sun's JSSE reference implementation to provide support for HTTPS. It is even possible to use the same pair of public/private keys as a pre-existing apache server by using the KeyPairTool to load the private key and its certificate into a keystore for JSSE.

<p> If the use of a commercial SSL implementation is required, <A HREF=http://www.forge.com.au>FORGE</A> have contributed a listener which allows their Protekt product to be used as an SSL provider. A similar approach may be used to integrate other SSL implementations.

<A NAME="Modular"></A>
<BR>&nbsp;<H3>Modular Architecture</H3>
Jetty request handling is based on collections of abstracted request listeners
and handlers. All Jetty features are provided by specializations of these
abstract components.   This allows Jetty's behaviour to be extended and/or
enhanced by the addition of extra listeners and handlers.
<P>
The associated <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=7322">JettyExtra</A> module contains extensions such as JMX configuration and SASL authentication. 

<A NAME="Embeddable"></A>
<BR>&nbsp;<H3>Embeddable</H3>
For many applications, HTTP is just another interface protocol. Jetty can
easily be embedded in such applications and products without adopting a 
WWW centric application architecture. Examples of embedded Jetty usage include:<UL>
<LI>Used as the HTTP provider and servlet container in the <A href="http://www.jboss.org">JBoss</A> J2EE application server.
<LI>Included in products shipped by IBM and Cisco.
<LI>Used for the CD demo disk in several books on XML and Servlets.
<LI>Run on embedded systems and handheld devices.
</UL>


<A NAME="Efficient"></A>
<H3>Small & Efficient</H3>
Jetty has been optimized by commercial and experimental use since 1995 and
a small and efficient server is the result: <UL>
  <LI>A HTTP server can be configured in a jar file under 200KB.
  <LI>Jetty consistently benchmarks as one of the fastest servlet servers.
  <LI>Jetty servers scale well to thousands of simultaneous connections
  <LI>Server performance degrades gracefully under stress.
</UL>

<A NAME="Config"></A>
<H3>Flexible Configuration</H3>       
Jetty has been designed to highly configurable and flexible. It can be used
as a stand-alone server running application servlets or it can be embedded
in java application to provide a WWW interface to the services that they
provide.  The configuration of a server is controlled by:<UL>
  <LI>J2EE deployment descriptors.
  <LI>Direct API calls.
  <LI>XML configuration.
</UL>

<A NAME="Proven"></A>
<H3>Proven in Production</H3>
Jetty has been widely used in projects and applications from hand helds to
main frames.   Jetty is shipped in products from major companies such as <A
href http://www.ibm.com>IBM</a> and <A href=http://www.cisco.com>Cisco</A>,
plus it has been bundled as the default server in other open source projects
including <A href="http://www.jboss.org">JBoss</A>, 
<A href="http://www.jxta.org">JXTA</A> and others.


<A NAME="EJB"></A>
<BR>&nbsp;<H3>J2EE Integration</H3>
Jetty is now the default server and web container for the <A HREF="http://www.jboss.org">JBoss</A> J2EE application server. This gives a complete J2EE solution with HTTP, Servlets, JSPs and EJBs all within a single JVM.
