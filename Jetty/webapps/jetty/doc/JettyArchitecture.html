These are just notes.  A nice annotated diagram is on its way...
<BR><BR>
<UL><LI> JVM contains one or more HttpServer instances.
<BR><BR>
</LI><LI> HttpServer contains one or more HttpListener instances.
</LI><LI> HttpServer contains one or more HandlerContext instances organized as an
  ordered list at each context path.
</LI><LI> HttpServer contains zero or more UserRealm instances.
<BR><BR>
</LI><LI> HandlerContext is registered at one and only one context pattern (eg.   
  /context/*).
</LI><LI> HandlerContext contains one or more HttpHandler instances organized
  in the order they were added.
<BR><BR>
</LI><LI> ResourceHandler is a HttpHandler that serves files.
</LI><LI> ServletHandler is a HttpHandler that serves configured Servlets by mapping
  a pathspec within the context (eg *.xxx, / or /XX/* ) to a ServletHolder
</LI><LI> DynamicHandler is a ServletHandler that uses class names in URLs to
  configure servlets.
</LI><LI> SecurityHandler is a HttpHandler that is mapped to UserRealm by name. 
<BR><BR>
</LI><LI> A WebApplication is a HandlerContext that uses a web.xml file to 
  initialize a ResourceHandler and a ServletHandler.
<BR><BR>
</LI><LI> A ServletContext is mapped to the HandlerContext, thus context
  initParams and attributes are in a context scope. </LI></UL><HR>
