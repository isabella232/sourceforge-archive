This page is a place for you to add unofficial task, feature requests,
and general wishes.   Please put your name against them as author or
supportor, so we can see if they should be elevated to official.

<B>Wish List:</B>
<UL><LI> Somebody to pay for Jetty and extensions to be developed full time (gregw@mortbay.com).
<BR><BR>
</LI><LI> The time to contribute to the development of the Servlet API, which
  I think is a little lost in the wilderness (gregw@mortbay.com).
<BR><BR>
</LI><LI> Full implementation of support for custom tag libraries are a requirement for true JSP 1.1 compliance.  (jsuntheimer@neo.rr.com)
<CODE><PRE>  + This needs to be done, so it should be made an official task
     also EJB refs etc.  Does anybody know how these tags are 
     meant to work?   (gregw@mortbay.com)</PRE></CODE>
<BR><BR>
</LI><LI> Detection of changes to a servlet or bean's *.java file, auto-compilation (with configurable java compiler), and loading of the resultant .class file.   (jsuntheimer@neo.rr.com)
<CODE><PRE>  - Is this not what JSPs do for you? This would be moderately
    expensive to implement and if done - I'd say only in a 
    special JDE mode.  (gregw@mortbay.com)
</PRE></CODE>
<BR><BR>
</LI><LI> Failover clustering.  (jsuntheimer@neo.rr.com) 
  <CODE><PRE> + I vote for this one (gregw@mortbay.com) </PRE></CODE>
<BR><BR>
</LI><LI> Distributed sessions over cluster. (jsuntheimer@neo.rr.com)
