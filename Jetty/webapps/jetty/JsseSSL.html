<h1>Using Jetty and JSSE</h1>

<p>This is an overview of how to use Jetty with JSSE as an SSL 
implementation.  The 1.0 release of JSSE contains both a frame
work for third party providers and a reference implementation.
These instructions detail how to use the reference implementation
and have been tested against keys generated from the sun keytool
utility and 024 and 2048 bit RSA keys from openssl

There are four steps to use Jetty and JSSE:
<ol>
 <li><a href="#demo">Try the SSL Demo</a></li>
 <li><a href="#getkeys">Get a private key and cert.</a></li>
 <li><a href="#loadkeys">Load the private key and cert into a Sun JKS keystore.</a></li>
 <li><a href="#usekeys">Configure Jetty to use JSSE and the keystore.</a></li>
</ol>

<p>
This document also contains an <a href="#environment">environment
description with version numbers</a> and a list of <a href="issues">outstanding issues</a>.

<h1>Jetty SSL Demo</h1>

The Jetty demo can be run with a packaged keystore by following these steps:
<ol>
  <li>Edit the etc/demo.xml file to uncomment the SSL listener.
  <li>Make sure that lib/com.sun.net.ssl.jar is in your CLASSPATH.
  <li>Run the demo with:<PRE>
      java com.mortbay.Jetty.Server etc/demo.xml
      </PRE>
      Startup is a little slower than normal.
  <li>Follow the link <A HREF="https://127.0.0.1:8443/jetty/index.html">https://127.0.0.1:8443/jetty/index.html</A>. Remember that the first access to the server via SSL will be very slow,
as the encryption providers are initialized.
</ol>

<h2><a name="getkeys">Step 1: Get the private key and cert.</a></h2>

If you already have a key and cert then skip to step <a href="#loadkeys">two</a>.

<P><B>Sun Key/Certificate Pair</B><BR>

In order to generate the certificate with the reference implementation 
you need to install the JSEE as a security provider for JDK.  You can do 
this by editing $JDK12/jre/lib/security/java.security and adding the 
following lines:
<pre>
      security.provider.2=com.sun.net.ssl.internal.ssl.Provider
</pre>
This is assuming that JSSE is the only additional provider you want
installed.  Note that all Jetty Jsse classes manually install  this
provider as needed, so it may be worthwhile removing this line after
the certificate has been generated, as it can interfer with other
providers (see loading OpenSSL keypair below). 

<p>
The certificate can be generated and loaded with the keytool utility 
with a command like:
<pre>
  keytool -genkey -keyalg RSA -storepass testpasswd -keypass testpasswd
</pre>



<P><B>OpenSSL Key/Certificate Pair</B><BR>
The procedure to get a key and certificate for use with OpenSSL
is described in <a href="http://www.thawte.com/">Thawte's</a> <a href="http://www.thawte.com/certs/server/keygen/apachessl.html">Apache SSL Key and CSR Generation Instructions.</a>

<p> Here is a log of me following a simplified version of those instructions.

<h2><a name="loadkeys">Step 2: Load the private key and cert into a Sun JKS keystore.</a></h2>

If a sun provider key/certificate pair was generated, then they are already 
loaded into the JKS keystore and this step can be 
<a href="#usekeys">skipped</A>.

<p>
During this step you will be doing a few exposed things from a security 
point of view, so only do this in a secure directory on a secure machine. 
Remember to clean up properly.

<P><B>Crypto Provider</B><BR>
The JSSE provider is not able to handle openSSL key pairs, so another 
provider is required. Get your hands on a copy of the Bouncy Castle 
Crypto Package from <a href="http://www.bouncycastle.org/">The Legion of 
the Bouncy Castle</a>. Other JCE 1.2 providers may work too but at the 
moment this is the one that this is tested against. You will only need 
it for the key loading stage so install it on your safe machine somewhere. 
<p>
To perform these step, you do not need to have any providers registered
in the JRE java.security file. In fact having the JSSE reference
provider registered can cause errors in the following step.
To use the bouncy castle provider, their classes directory must be
in your classpath, for example:
<PRE>
  export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:/usr/local/java/bouncycastle/jce-jdk12-10b3/classes
</PRE>
You can test the bouncy castle installation by running the following
test harnesses:
<PRE>
  java org.bouncycastle.crypto.test.RegressionTest
  java org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.test.RegressionTest
</PRE>

<P><B>Extracting your Private Key</B><BR>
Firstly you will need to decrypt the private key. Do this using openssl like this:
<pre>
<b>$</b> openssl rsa -in bee.hive.net.key -out bee.hive.net.clearkey -outform DER
read RSA key
Enter PEM pass phrase:
writing RSA key
</pre>
If this fails, check that the sun security provider is not registered in 
the java.security file.  It only needs to be registered their if you are
generating your keys with sun's keytool. Jetty registers the provider on
an as need be basis. 
<P>
<B>REMEMBER TO DELETE YOU CLEAR KEY WHEN YOU COMPLETE THE NEXT STEP</B>


<P>
<hr>
<B>Loading Private Key and Certificate into the keystore</B><BR>
Next, load the key and the cert into a JKS keystore. The class 
com.mortbay.Util.KeyPairTool is used to load the keys into the
keystore. It has the following arguments:
<pre>
<b>$</b> java com.mortbay.Util.KeyPairTool
Tool to insert a private key/certificate pair into a keystore.
Parameters:
 -key        FILENAME, location of private key [MANDATORY]
 -cert       FILENAME, location of certificate [MANDATORY]
 -keystore   FILENAME, location of keystore,   [~/.keystore]
 -storetype  STRING,   name/type of keystore,  [jks]
 -alias      NAME,     alias used to store key [mykey]
 -provider   NAME,     name of provider class  [...BouncyCastleProvider]

The keystore and key passwords will be prompted for or can be
set with the following JVM system properties:
  jetty.ssl.password  
  jetty.ssl.keypassword
</pre>
If passwords are not provided as properties, they are prompted for.
While they still appear on the screen, this is a much safer option as they
do not get saved in shell histories or process listings.
<pre>
<b>$</b> /bin/sh
$ java com.mortbay.Util.KeyPairTool \
  -key bee.hive.net.clearkey \
  -cert bee.hive.net.crt \
  -storepass testpasswd \
  -keystore mykeystore
Loaded the private key...
Loaded the public key...
Will create keystore: keypair.keystore
Keys have been written to keystore
</pre>
<p>
<B><font color=red> Remember to clean up!</font></B> a simple way to do this without going to overboard is:
<pre>
<b>$</b> man man > bee.hive.net.clearkey
<b>$</b> cat /var/log/messages | compress > bee.hive.net.clearkey
<b>$</b> man ls > bee.hive.net.clearkey
<b>$</b> rm bee.hive.net.clearkey
</pre>
<p> 
You now have a keystore with your keypair stashed away in it.   If you
ignored the previous step, you also have your private key in the clear in
your file system - SO CLEAN UP! This is your last warning.
<p>
You can use the jdk-1.2 keytool to manipulate the key/cert now that it is in
there. You can use it to change the password for instance.
<pre>
<b>$</b> keytool -storepasswd
Enter keystore password:  testpasswd
New keystore password:  newpasswd
Re-enter new keystore password:  newpasswd

keytool -list
Enter keystore password:  newpasswd

Keystore type: jks
Keystore provider: SUN

Your keystore contains 1 entry:

mykey, Sat Aug 12 21:11:19 GMT+10:00 2000, keyEntry,
Certificate fingerprint (MD5): 1A:DA:C0:35:F0:A3:EC:AD:AB:D8:5F:48:78:A0:CB:90
<b>$</b> 
</pre>

<P><HR><P>
<h2><a name="usekeys">Step 3: Configure Jetty to use JSSE and the keystore.</a></h2>
<p>Assuming you already have a functioning Jetty Server:

<p>
Add the SunJsseListener as a HttpListeners, e.g. In the demo.xml file 
you can uncomment the following lines:
<pre>
  &lt;Call name="addListener"&gt;
    &lt;Arg&gt;
      &lt;New class="com.mortbay.HTTP.SunJsseListener"&gt;
        &lt;Set name="Port"&gt;8443&lt;/Set&gt;
        &lt;Set name="MinThreads"&gt;5&lt;/Set&gt;
        &lt;Set name="MaxThreads"&gt;255&lt;/Set&gt;
        &lt;Set name="MaxIdleTimeMs"&gt;50000&lt;/Set&gt;
	&lt;Set name="Password"&gt;secretPassword&lt;/Set&gt;
	&lt;Set name="KeyPassword"&gt;verySecretPassword&lt;/Set&gt;
      &lt;/New&gt;
    &lt;/Arg&gt;
  &lt;/Call&gt;
</pre>
<p> 

Remember that the default port for https is 443 not 80, so change 80 to 443 if you want to be able to use URL's without explicit port numbers. For a production site it normally makes sense to have a HttpListener on port 80 and a SunJsseListener on port 443.

<p>
Choose a private directory with restricted access to keep your keystore
in. Even though it has a password on it, the password may be configured 
into the runtime environment so is vulnerable to theft.

<p>
Change the way you start Jetty to:
<ul>
 <li> Include con.sun.net.ssl.jar in the classpath.
      Remember you no longer need bouncycastle in you classpath.</li>
 <li> Provide the path to the keystore file as the jetty.ssl.keystore property </li>
 <li> Provide the keystore and key passwords, either as the
      jetty.ssl.password and jetty.ssl.keypassword properties or 
      typed at a prompt.
</li>
</ul>

For example:
<pre>
java -Djetty.ssl.keystore=/home/jetty/keystore  com.mortbay.Jetty.Demo

jetty.ssl.password : testpasswd
jetty.ssl.keypassword : testpasswd

</pre>
<p>
You may then access the SSL port with a URL like:

  https://yourhost:8443/Dump

If you get an javax.net.ssl.SSLException, check that you have 
remembered the s in https.

<P>
<hr>
<B>Password Issues</B><BR>
The passwords can also be set on the command line as system properties, but
remember that putting your password on the command line is a security risk.
They can also be set as properties within the config file, but
this risks accidental discovery by developers.
<P>
If jetty is given a password that begins with &quot;EXEC:&quot;, then
the rest of the password is treated as a command and run with
java.lang.Runtime.exec.  The password name (eg. jetty.ssl.password) 
is written to the input of the command and a line of output is read
from the command and used as the password.
<p>
If jetty is given a password that begins with &quot;OBF:&quot; it is
treated as an obfuscated password. Passwords can be obfuscated by
running com.mortbay.Util.Password as a main class.
<p>
While these mechanism just exports the security problem from jetty,
it does allow customized security arrangements to be configured.
