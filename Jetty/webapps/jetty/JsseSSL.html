<h1>Jetty SSL Demo</h1>

The Jetty demo can be run with a packaged keystore by following these steps:
<ol>
  <li>Edit the etc/demo.xml file to uncomment the SSL listener.
  <li>Make sure that lib/com.sun.net.ssl.jar is in your CLASSPATH.
  <li>Run the demo with:<PRE>
      java com.mortbay.Jetty.Server etc/demo.xml
      </PRE>
      Startup is slower than normal as the SecureRandom class must be initialized.
  <li>Follow the link <A HREF="https://127.0.0.1:8443/jetty/index.html">https://127.0.0.1:8443/jetty/index.html</A>. Remember that the first access to the server via SSL will be slower than usual as the SSL session will need to be negotiated - subsequent requests will be processed much more rapidly.
</ol>
