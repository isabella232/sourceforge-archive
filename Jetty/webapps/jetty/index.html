<BR><H1>Jetty Java HTTP Servlet Server</H1>
Jetty is an <A HREF="http://www.opensource.org">Open Source</A> 
HTTP Servlet Server written in 100% Java. It is designed to be light 
weight, high performance, embeddable, extensible and flexible, thus 
making it an ideal platform for serving  dynamic HTTP requests from 
any Java application.

Java Servlet API White Paper</A>:
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>
Java is a great platform for writing the server side of your web-based
application. Servlets are emerging as the preferred way of creating highly
dynamic WWW services linked to real backend applications and databases.
See the growing trend at <a href="http://www.servletcentral.com">http://www.servletcentral.com</a>.
<P>
Java makes it easy to develop and deploy all parts of a professional, maintainable distributed system application. The Servlet API
provides you the fastest way to start using Java Server technology in your networked applications. You can start with applications which
involve clients and a single server, and gradually create multi-tier enterprise applications which integrate the power and flexibility of Java
throughout your existing network ... because Java Servlets run on the software and hardware you've already installed.

<A NAME="Open"></A>
<H3>Open Source License</H3>
Jetty is released under an <A HREF="http://www.opensource.org">Open Source</A>
License, derived from the Artistic License. Full source code is included in
the release. <B><A HREF=/jetty/LICENSE.html>The License</A></B> puts few restrictions on usage of Jetty.


<A NAME="HTTP11"></A>
<BR>&nbsp;<H3>HTTP/1.1 Protocol</H3>
Jetty supports the HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1 protocols. The 1.1 protocol offers
much greater network performance.  Furthermore, as the HTTP server and the
Servlet container and in the same JVM, this gives simpler configuration, 
much greater performance and full access to all server resources from 
within servlets.


<A NAME="Servlets"></A>
<BR>&nbsp;<H3>Serving Servlets</H3>
Jetty supports the javax.servlet. API defined by
<A HREF=http://www.javasoft.com>JavaSoft</A>:
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>
Servlets are protocol- and platform-independent server side components,
written in Java, which dynamically extend Java-enabled
servers. They provide a general framework for services built using the
request-response paradigm. </I> [Javasoft's Java Servlet API White Paper]
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Jetty 2 uses the 2.1 Servlet API and Jetty 3 uses the 2.2 Servlet API.


<A NAME="JSP"></A>
<BR>&nbsp;<H3>Java Server Pages</H3>
Jetty includes a JSP package, which implements Java Server Pages, a method
for adding dynamic content to HTML pages. Currently this is the Jasper JSP
engine from apache.


<A NAME="SSL"></A>
<BR>&nbsp;<H3>SSL Support</H3>
Jetty has a <A HREF="/jetty/JsseSSL.html">SunJsseListener</A> which uses Sun's JSSE reference implementation to provide support for HTTPS. It is even possible to use the same pair of public/private keys as a pre-existing apache server by using the KeyPairTool to load the private key and its certificate into a keystore for JSSE.

<p> If the use of a commercial SSL implementation is required, <A HREF=http://www.forge.com.au>FORGE</A> have contributed a listener which allows their Protekt product to be used as an SSL provider. A similar approach may be used to integrate other SSL implementations.


<A NAME="Modular"></A>
<BR>&nbsp;<H3>Modular Architecture</H3>
Jetty request handling is based on collections of abstracted request listeners
and handlers. All Jetty features are provided by specializations of these
abstract components.   This allows Jetty's behaviour to be extended and/or
enhanced by the addition of extra listeners and handlers.
<P>
The <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=7322">Jetty3Extra</A> repository contains extension such as
JMX configuration and SASL authentication. 

<A NAME="Embeddable"></A>
<BR>&nbsp;<H3>Embeddable</H3>
For many applications, HTTP is just another interface protocol. Jetty can
easily be embedded in such applications and products without adopting a 
WWW centric application architecture. A good example of this style of usage
is in a distributed system, where each process runs it's own Jetty server
in order to present a managment and monitoring Web interface. 

<A NAME="Efficient"></A>
<BR>&nbsp;<H3>Small & Efficient</H3>
Jetty has been optimized by commercial and experimental use since 1995 and
a small and efficient server is the result: <UL>
  <LI>A full featured server can be configured in a jar file under 200KB.
  <LI>Optimized parsing is performed on requests.
  <LI>Minimal Object and thread creation.
  <LI>Server performance degrades gracefully under stress.
</UL>

<A NAME="Config"></A>
<H3>Flexible Configuration</H3>       
Jetty has been designed to highly configurable and flexible. It can be used
as a stand-alone server running application servlets or it can be embedded
in java application to provide a WWW interface to the services that they
provide.  The configuration of a server is controlled by:<UL>
  <LI>J2EE deployment descriptors.
  <LI>Direct API calls.
  <LI>XML configuration.
</UL>

<A NAME="HTML"></A>
<H3>HTML Generation</H3>
While HTML is a simple language to learn and write, it can be also be
very tedious, contrived and error prone.  Furthermore, authored HTML
is a static resource and cannot be customized to each request or updated
from a database.
<P>
Jetty comes with a rich HTML generation package that can be used on its
own, with another servlet server or in Jetty servlets. Supported for
templated look and feel is a key element of this package.

<A NAME="EJB"></A>
<BR>&nbsp;<H3>EJB Integration</H3>
Jetty has been instrumented as JMX model MBeans which allows it
to be seamlessly integrated into the <A HREF="http://www.jboss.org">JBoss</A> EJB 
application server. This gives a complete J2EE container with 
HTTP, Servlets, JSPs and EJBs all within a single JVM.
