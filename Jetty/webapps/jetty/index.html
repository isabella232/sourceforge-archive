<BR><H1>Jetty Java HTTP Servlet Server</H1>
Jetty is an <A HREF="http://www.opensource.org">Open Source</A> 
HTTP Servlet Server written in 100% Java. It is designed to be light 
weight, high performance, embeddable, extensible and flexible, thus 
making it an ideal platform for serving  dynamic HTTP requests from 
any Java application.

Java Servlet API White Paper</A>:
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>
Java is a great platform for writing the server side of your web-based
application. Servlets are emerging as the preferred way of creating highly
dynamic WWW services linked to real backend applications and databases.
See the growing trend at <a href="http://www.servletcentral.com">http://www.servletcentral.com</a>.
<P>
Java makes it easy to develop and deploy all parts of a professional, maintainable distributed system application. The Servlet API
provides you the fastest way to start using Java Server technology in your networked applications. You can start with applications which
involve clients and a single server, and gradually create multi-tier enterprise applications which integrate the power and flexibility of Java
throughout your existing network ... because Java Servlets run on the software and hardware you've already installed.

<A NAME="Servlets"></A>
<BR>&nbsp;<H3>Serving Servlets</H3>
Jetty supports the javax.servlet. API defined by
<A HREF=http://www.javasoft.com>JavaSoft</A>:
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>
Servlets are protocol- and platform-independent server side components,
written in Java, which dynamically extend Java-enabled
servers. They provide a general framework for services built using the
request-response paradigm. </I> [Javasoft's Java Servlet API White Paper]
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Jetty 2 uses the 2.1 Servlet API and Jetty 3 uses the 2.2 Servlet API.

<A NAME="HTTP11"></A>
<BR>&nbsp;<H3>HTTP/1.1 Protocol</H3>
Jetty supports the HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1 protocols. The 1.1 protocol offers
much greater network performance.  Furthermore, as the HTTP server and the
Servlet container and in the same JVM, this gives simpler configuration, 
much greater performance and full access to all server resources from 
within servlets.

<A NAME="Modular"></A>
<BR>&nbsp;<H3>Modular Architecture</H3>
Jetty request handling is based on stacks of abstracted request handlers.
All Jetty features are provided by modular request handlers that are stacked
together to provide an  optimal set of handlers or new handlers
may be written for server extensions.
Current Handlers provided with Jetty include:<UL>
  <LI>Logging.
  <LI>Basic Authentication.
  <LI>Sessions.
  <LI>Translates.
  <LI>Response Filtering.
  <LI>Servlet Handling.
  <LI>File Serving.
  <LI>Request Forwarding.
  <LI>Proxy Server.
  <LI>Forms, querries & Cookies.
</UL>
Key classes within Jetty are dynamicaly loaded so that they may be replaced
with alternate or extended implementations. For example SSL handling is
provided by extending the standard HttpListener class.


<A NAME="Embeddable"></A>
<BR>&nbsp;<H3>Embeddable</H3>
For many applications, HTTP is just another interface protocol. Jetty can
easily be embedded in such applications and products without adopting a 
WWW centric application architecture. A good example of this style of usage
is in a distributed system, where each process runs it's own Jetty server
in order to present a managment and monitoring Web interface. 

<A NAME="JSP"></A>
<BR>&nbsp;<H3>GNU Java Server Pages</H3>
Jetty includes a JSP package, which implements Java Server Pages, a method
for adding dynamic content to HTML pages.


<A NAME="SSL"></A>
<BR>&nbsp;<H3>SSL Support</H3>
A HttpListener extension class has been contributed by
<A HREF=http://www.forge.com.au>FORGE</A> that integrates their
Protekt SSL product with Jetty. A similar approach may be used to
integrate other SSL implementations.


<A NAME="Efficient"></A>
<BR>&nbsp;<H3>Small & Efficient</H3>
Jetty has been optimized by commercial and experimental use since 1995 and
a small and efficient server is the result: <UL>
  <LI>A full featured server can be configured in a jar file under 100KB.
  <LI>Optimized parsing is performed on requests.
  <LI>Minimal Object and thread creation.
  <LI>Server performance degrades reasonably under stress.
</UL>


<A NAME="Config"></A>
<BR>&nbsp;<H3>Flexible Configuration</H3>       
Jetty has been designed to highly configurable and flexible. It can be used
as a stand-alone server running application servlets or it can be embedded
in java application to provide a WWW interface to the services that they
provide.  The configuration of a server is controlled by an abstract
interface of which there are several implementations:<UL>
  <LI>Property file driven configuration.
  <LI>Dynamic loading of servlets from path.
  <LI>Dedicated File Serving from current directory.
  <LI>Interpretation of other common server configuration files.
  <LI>Application specific configuration implementations.
</UL>



<A NAME="Filtering"></A>
<BR>&nbsp;<H3>Response Filtering</H3>
Jetty provides a mechanism to allow filters to be conditionally inserted
into the output stream of a response to a request.  These filters, which
are activated on content type, allow pages arbitrary changes to be made to
responses that may have been generated, retrieved from a file or even
fetched from another server.
<p>
Jetty provides a filter for HTML which can use reflection to execute
Java method calls embedded in specially formatted HTML comments.
This is allows dynamic content to be added to pages that have been
statically authored or generated elsewhere.
Support is provided to use this mechanism for server side includes and
URL embedding.



<A NAME="Util"></A>
<BR>&nbsp;<H3>Utility Classes </B></BR> 
Bundled with Jetty are several utility packages which form a good basis
for a Java software infrastructure for WWW development, including:
<UL>
  <LI><A HREF=/javadoc/com/mortbay/Util/Code.html>Code debugging, asserts, warnings and event logging</A>.
  <LI><A HREF=/javadoc/com/mortbay/Util/Test.html>Test harness for automated regression testing</A>.
  <LI><A HREF=/javadoc/com/mortbay/FTP/package-summary.html>FTP client package</A>.
  <LI><A HREF=/javadoc/com/mortbay/HTML/package-summary.html>HTML Generation</A>.
  <LI><A HREF=/javadoc/com/mortbay/JDBC/package-summary.html>JDBC wrappers</A>.
  <LI><A HREF=/javadoc/com/mortbay/Util/package-summary.html>Property Tree files</A>.
  <LI><A HREF=/javadoc/com/mortbay/Util/package-summary.html>Net and IO utilities</A>.
</UL>


<A NAME="HTML"></A>
<BR>&nbsp;<H3>HTML Generation</H3>
While HTML is a simple language to learn and write, it can be also be
very tedious, contrived and error prone.  Furthermore, authored HTML
is a static resource and cannot be customized to each request or updated
from a database.
<P>
Jetty comes with a rich HTML generation package that can be used on its
own, with another servlet server or in Jetty servlets. Supported for
templated look and feel is a key element of this package.
