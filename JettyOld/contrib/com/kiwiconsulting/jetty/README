UPDATE: 16 June 2000 - Preston L. Bannister <preston@home.com>

The Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE) is currently available from:

  http://java.sun.com/products/jsse/
  
The current version at the time of this writing is JSSE 1.0.1 which 
requires that you have Java 1.2.1 or later.

This implementation of a JSEE SSL adaptor has been contributed to
Jetty but not tested.

From: court demas <court@kiwiconsulting.com>

I've managed to add SSL support to Jetty using Sun's reference SSL
implementation (JSSE).

This was an incredible hassle due to a serious lack of documentation in
the JSSE beta release.  It's also quite a bit of a hack for the same
reason - but it works.  I basically just copied over the Proteckt SSL
adapter source; and then banged my head against the wall until morning.

You need:
- Jetty (I'm using 2.3.3)
- JDK 1.2 (I'm using blackdown jdk 1.2pre2 on gnu/linux redhat 6.1/i386)

- JCCE 1.0 beta
(http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/earlyAccess/jsse/)
- jettyjsse.jar (attached)

Steps:
- install the above packages
- put the Jetty, the JCCE jars, and jettyjsse.jar in your classpath
- create a certificate:
     keytool -genkey -keyalg RSA -keypass password -storepass password
  In order to generate the certificate you need to install the JSEE as a
  security provider for JDK.  You can do this by editing
  $JDK12/jre/lib/security/java.security and adding the following lines:

      security.provider.2=com.sun.net.ssl.internal.ssl.Provider

  (This is assuming that JSSE is the only additional provider you want
  installed.)

  Also, you must copy the jar files from the JSEE distribution to the JRE
  extentions directory:

      cp $JSEE/lib/*.jar $JDK1.2/jre/lib/ext


- java com.mortbay.Jetty.Server secureserver.prp
- netscape https://127.0.0.1:4233/

That should do it.

I've attached the source & binary for the listener class and a sample
configuration file.
