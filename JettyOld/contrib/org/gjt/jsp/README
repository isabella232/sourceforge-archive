                             GNUJSP version 1.0

   GNUJSP is a free implementation of Sun's Java Server Pages. Once the
   GNUJSP servlet is correctly installed, files with the extension .jsp
   are translated into java source files, compiled, and run.

Features

     * JSP specification 1.0 is supported.
     * GNUJSP runs on a wide range of platforms, webservers and servlet
       engines. See the section on compatibility for details.
     * Modified JSP pages are automatically recompiled if desired.
     * The JDK's builtin compiler or an external compiler like jikes can
       be used.
     * Comes with GNU Classpath's implementation of the servlet standard
       extension.
       
Compatibility

   GNUJSP should work with any JSDK 2.0 or JSDK 2.1 servlet engine.  The
   previous version (0.9.x) was deployed successfully with a long list of
   web servers and servlet engines.  However, we are currently actively
   testing the following:
	- Apache 1.3.6/1.3.9 with Apache JServ 1.0 (see INSTALL.apache)
	- Jigsaw 2.1.0 (see INSTALL.jigsaw)
	- vqServer 1.9.17 (see INSTALL.vqserver)
   See install.html for general installation and configuration notes.
   If you have success with other servers and engines, we'd like to hear
   about it at gnujsp@gjt.org so we can add it to the list.
