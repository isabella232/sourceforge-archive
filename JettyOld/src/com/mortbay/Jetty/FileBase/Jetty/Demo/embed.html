<h1>Server-Side Embedding</h1>
<TABLE><TR><TD>
Embedding is similar to server side includes. However, instead of a file, it
is the content of a URL fetched from another server, that is inserted into
the page.
<p>
When generating HTML, the class com.mortbay.HTTP.HTML.EmbedUrl class can
be used to embed a URL in the generated page.  
When serving HTML from a non generated source, the method
com.mortbay.HTTP.Filter.HtmlFilter.embedUrl() can be called from a 
filter tag.
<p>
This page uses a filter to embed the include demo page which appears in 
a box below. 
The source is also included below.
