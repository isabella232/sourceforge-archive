<h1>Server Push & Multi-part MIME</h1>
Because Jetty assigns each request it own Thread, it is a simple matter
for that thread to continue execution and  send updates
back to the browser, continually or in response to some asynchronous
condition.
<p>Combined with Multi-part MIME encoding it is possible for the server
to update the entire browser frame when ever it chooses.
<P>
Many browsers support server push and multi part MIME, but unfortunately
MSIE 3 is not among them.

Click <A HREF=/Demo/push>here</A> to see simple example.

The <A HREF=/Chat>Chat</A> demo is also a good example.
