<h1>Basic Authentication</h1>
Jetty supports basic HTTP authentication with it's AuthHandler class.
This site has 2 realms configured, called "Basic" and "Other".
<P>
Click <A HREF=/Auth/Jetty/Demo/auth.html>here</A> to fetch this page via
the "Basic" realm (user=jetty password=jetty).
<P>
Click <A HREF=/Other/Jetty/Demo/auth.html>here</A> to fetch this page via
the "Other" realm (user=other password=other).
<P>
Note that these links use request translation to guide the authenticated
requests back to this page. The <A HREF=/Auth/Dump>dump</A>
demo also shows the operation of basic authentication.
