<h1>Property Trees and the Property Tree Editor</h1>
<p> Property Trees are Properties that allow other Properties to be nested
and also provide wildcard default values. The interface for
<A HREF="/javadoc/com/mortbay/Util/PropertyTree.html">
com.mortbay.Util.PropertyTree</a> is identical to standard java Properties
but keys such as "a.b" can be used to refer to nested PropertyTrees. These
can then be retrieved and iterated over or saved out individually. More
information is contained in the
<A HREF="/javadoc/com/mortbay/Util/PropertyTree.html">
javadoc</a> for the class.

<p> The <a href="/PropertyTree"><strong>Property Tree Editor</strong></a>
servlet can demonstrate how these work.
