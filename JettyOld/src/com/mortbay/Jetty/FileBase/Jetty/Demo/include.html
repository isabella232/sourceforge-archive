<h1>Generated Server-Side Includes</h1>
<TABLE><TR><TD>
The HTML package provides the com.mortbay.HTML.Include class which is
a HTML Element that can be added to a generated HTML page. The Include
instance is contructed with a directory and filename and includes the
contents of the file into the page at the time of generation.
<P>
This page has been generated by com.mortbay.Servlets.LookAndFeelServlet
which uses the Include element to wrap a HTML stub in the site
Look and Feel.  This  page was generated with the following lines:
<PRE>
Page page = Page.getLookAndFeel(lookAndFeelName);
...
page.add(new Include(fileBase,
                     request.getServletPath()+
                     request.getPathInfo()));
</PRE>
Where the servletPath /Jetty/Demo has been mapped to LookAndFeelServlet
and the pathInfo of /include.html is used to select the file to be wrapped
in the look and feel selected in the servlets configuration.
<p>
The contents of the include.html file is listed below. Not that it does not
need to contain any HTML for the header, footer or other visual elements as
these are provided by the look and feel page into which the file is included.
Further note that the source of the file has been included using another
Jetty server side inlcusion mechanism, <A HREF=filter.html>Filters</A>,
which are more suitable for non generated pages. So this page is
generated by a servlet which uses a generated HTML element
to include a file, which in turn uses a filtered include tag to
include its own source.
