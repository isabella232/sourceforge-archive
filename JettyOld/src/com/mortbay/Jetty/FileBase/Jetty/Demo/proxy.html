<h1>Proxy Handler</h1>
<TABLE><TR><TD>
This demo server has been configured as a proxy server for HTTP and FTP
requests.  If you alter your browser configuration to set this server as
its proxy, then you can browse HTTP and FTP sites that are visible to the
machine the server is running on. If you browse the other parts of this
server, you will see two requests in the request log, one as a proxy the
other as the real request.
<p>
To demonstrate the proxy without changing your browser, the server will
handle the following this
<A HREF="/ProxyDump/path?A=B">link</A>
by translating it to a proxy request, then forwarding it to itself, where
it will be handled as a proxy request by again forwarding the request to
itself and accessing the Dump servlet. Careful examination of the
debug trace or request log will be required to see this actually working.
Note that request logs are written as requests complete, so the link
above will generate three entries in reverse order.
