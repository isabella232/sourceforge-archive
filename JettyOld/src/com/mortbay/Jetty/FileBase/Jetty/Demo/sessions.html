<h1>User Sessions and Browser Id</h1>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Jetty uses it's handler architecture and cookie support to
provide user session and browser tracking.
<p>
Whenever a request without a session Id or a browser Id is received,
a new Id is generated and sent as a set-cookie in the response. Session Id
cookies are set to expire with the browser session and browser Id cookies are
set to expire in 100 years.
<p>
As some browsers do not support cookies, a session status and browser status
are maintained. These indicate if an Id is newly assigned, Old (ie from a
previous run of the server) or OK (been set and received by the browser).
<p>
On request, Jetty creates a Hashtable associated with a session Id. Values
may set, modified or deleted in this session data to allow communication and
state to be passed between multiple requests from the same session.
