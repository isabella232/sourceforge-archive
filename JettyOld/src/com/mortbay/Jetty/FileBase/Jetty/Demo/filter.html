<h1>Response Filtering</h1>
<TABLE><TR><TD>
Jetty provides a mechanism to allow filters to be conditionally inserted
into the output stream of a response to a request.  These filters, which
are activated on content type, allow pages arbitrary changes to be made to
responses that may have been generated, retrieved from a file or even
fetched from another server (See <A HREF=forward.html>forwarding</A>).
<P>
The class FilterHandler can be used to insert filters
into a response, determined by the request path.
<P>
Developers can extend
<A HREF="/javadoc/com/mortbay/HTTP/HttpFilter.html">
com.mortbay.HTTP.HttpFilter</A>
to implement a filters. Jetty provides the utility filter
<A HREF="/javadoc/com/mortbay/HTTP/Filter/HtmlFilter.html">
com.mortbay.HTTP.Filter.HtmlFilter</A>,
which scans HTML responses for specially formatted HTML comments.
These comments contain a call to a Java method on a class. Java reflextion
is used to find the class and static method and invoke the method with
the given arguements.
<p>
Static methods are also provided by  
<A HREF="/javadoc/com/mortbay/HTTP/Filter/HtmlFilter.html">
com.mortbay.HTTP.Filter.HtmlFilter</A> To include files or embed pages
fetched from URLs.
<p>
The source of this page is included below using  
<A HREF="/javadoc/com/mortbay/HTTP/Filter/HtmlFilter.html">
com.mortbay.HTTP.Filter.HtmlFilter</A>.includePreFile().

Other potential uses for filters include:<UL>
  <LI>Encryption and/or authentication with digital signatures
  <LI>Modification of link URLs for link tracking or page relocation.
  <LI>Embedding application specific dynamic content in authored HTML pages.
  <LI>Translation of formats not supported by a browser eg. JPG to GIF or
