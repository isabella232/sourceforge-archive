<h1>Forward Requests</h1>
<TABLE><TR><TD>
When developing a WWW site, it often is desirable to combine the
features of several different servers.  Jetty can forward requests that
it receives to another WWW server and pass the response it back as the
response to the original request.
<P>
While similar to a redirect, forwarding offers several key benefits:<UL>
  <LI>The response is passed back through Jetty, so it may be filtered
       or modified in other ways.
  <LI>The browser only sees a single request and response and two
       round trips are not required.
  <LI>The client does not need to access the destination server, so it
       may be placed behind a firewall on a secure network. Jetty thus
       can act as a smart proxy.
</UL>
For this demonstration, a forward handler has been configured to forward
all request to paths begining with "/Forward" to the localhost, ie. Jetty
is forwarding the request to itself.  All of the following URLs
