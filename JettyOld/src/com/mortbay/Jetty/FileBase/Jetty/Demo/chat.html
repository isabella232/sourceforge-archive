<h1>Chat Room</h1>
<TABLE><TR><TD>
This demonstration is of a simple chat servlet implemented in Jetty. It is
an excellent demonstration of frames, look&feels, authentication and
server push.<P>
The Header and Footer frames are created by the JettyLaF look and feel
class, without any knowledge of the chat servlet.  The chat servlet then
creates its frames inside the content area defined by the look and feel.
<P>
Click <A HREF="/Chat">here</A> to enter the chat room using normal
authentication.    If you want to talk to yourself, use one of the
following links to simulate another user:<BR>
<CENTER>
<A HREF="/ChatNoAuth?user=tom">tom</A>,
<A HREF="/ChatNoAuth?user=dick">dick</A>,
<A HREF="/ChatNoAuth?user=harry">harry</A>,
</CENTER>
<P>
Note that MSIE3 does not support server push, so this demo will not work
for that browser.
