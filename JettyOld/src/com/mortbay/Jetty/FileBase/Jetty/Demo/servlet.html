<h1>Jetty Servlet Serving Demo</h1>
Jetty supports the javax.servlet.* API defined by JavaSoft. Most of this
demonstration site is generated from servlets and is probably demonstration
enough.  However, to demonstrate the multi-server nature of the
servlet API, the following link runs the Hello World servlet class file
supplied with the Java Servlet Developers Kit.
