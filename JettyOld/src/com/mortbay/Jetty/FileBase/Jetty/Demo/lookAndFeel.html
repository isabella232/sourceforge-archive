<h1>Look and Feel Handling</h1>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
One of the large benefits of generated HTML, is that the principles of
Object Oriented porgramming can be applied to extract the common elements
from a collection of pages.  The code to generate the common elements
needs to only be written once and reused or specialized by all the
pages.
<P>
Generation of a WWW sites Look and Feel is a prime example of a
common element which can be encapsulated in a single class.
This sites look and feel has been generated from the class
com.mortbay.Jetty.JettyLaF which is a specialization of
com.mortbay.HTML.Page.   This particular Page derivation
supports two styles of look and feel, which can be simply switched
for the entire site:
<P>
<A HREF=/Jetty?ToggleLaF=Yes>Toggle Look and Feel for site</A>
<P>
The servlet used in the
<A HREF=/Jetty/Demo/generate.html>HTML generation</A> demonstration can
be updated to use the default look and feel with a one line change.
Click <A HREF=/Demo/generateLaf>here</A> to see a the genreted HTML demo
in this sites default look and feel.
The source that generated that HTML is included below.
