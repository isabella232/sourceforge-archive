<h1>Demo Jetty Site Configuration</h1>
<TABLE><TR><TD>
This site has been configured with a hard coded implementation of
HttpConfiguration.  While not the most flexible configuration option,
hardcoding configuration does have benefits with regards to issues such
as configuration control and independance of configuration files.
<p>
The configuration of the individual servlets is the most complex part
of this site, with the IndexServlet configuration requiring large
String arrays to be constructed.
<p>
Finally, the complete stack of handlers configured for the "/" path
is not very efficient, nor would it be required for most sites.
