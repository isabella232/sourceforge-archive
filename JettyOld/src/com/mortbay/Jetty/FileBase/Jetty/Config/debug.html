<h1>Debug configuration</h1>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TABLE><TR><TD>
Jetty is instrumented with the debugging facilities of the
<A HREF=/javadoc/com/mortbay/Base/package-summary.html>com.mortbay.Base</A>
package.  It is strongly recommended that Jetty developers also use this
package.<p>
Debugging is activated and controlled by setting JVM properties. The
main property is DEBUG, which if set with the -DDEBUG command line
option to java, will enable debug output.
<p>Which classes generated debug can be controlled with the DEBUG_PATTERNS
property, which if set to a comma separated list of strings, is used to
select debug output from only those methods whose class or method name
contain one of the strings as a substring.
<p>The LOG_OPTIONS property can be set to control the format of the
debug output. The following options may be set:
<PRE>
 t Timestamp log output
 T Show the log tag name
 L Show log label (thread, method and file names).
 s Show indication of stack depth
 S Stack trace for each output line (VERY VERBOSE)
 O Place each log one One line of output
</PRE>
<p>
Debug configuration can also be during run time. The
<A href=/Debug>DebugServlet</A> can
be configured into any Servlet server to allow easy manipulation of
of debug settings.
