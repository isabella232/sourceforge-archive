<h1>HttpHandler Vs Servlets</h1>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TABLE><TR><TD>
Jetty has two main mechanism by which request handling code can
be added to the server: HttpHandlers and Servlets.
<P>As the proposed standard, Servlets must be the prefered development
mechanism.  Applications written to the servlet API should be able to
run on any server supporting the standard API.
<P>However, the servlet API does not allow the request to be modified,
nor does is allow complete access to the input and output streams
associated with a request.  If these features are required, then
a HttpHandler can be used as the basis.  Typically HttpHandlers will
modify or synthensize a request for later handling by a servlet, file
or forwarded server.
