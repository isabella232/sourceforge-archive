<h1>Generated Vs Templated Pages</h1>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TABLE><TR><TD>
There are two main approaches to generating dynamic pages:<BR>
<B>Generation</B> of HTML from servlets or handlers<BR>
<B>Template</B> HTML files which have previously been authored, are
modified with dynamic elements.<P>
Which approach is best depends on the circumstances.  Generation allows
for greater configuration control and reuse of common elements, but requires
programming skills and can be tedious to generate large once off static
pages. Templates can be a configuration and/or reuse problem, but allow
page development to be done by HTML authors using standard tools.
<P>
Most complex sites (including this one) will end up using a
combination of the techniques, skewed towards the experience and background
of the developers and maintainers.
