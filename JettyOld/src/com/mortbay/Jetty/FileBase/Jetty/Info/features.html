<h1>Jetty Java HTTP Server</h1>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TABLE><TR><TD>
Jetty is a HTTP Server written entirely in
Java. It is designed to be embedable, extensible and
flexible, thus making it an ideal platform for serving 
dynamic HTTP requests from any Java application.
Jetty supports the javax.servlet API defined
by JavaSoft plus many more features.
<P>
Jetty is not intended to be used as a stand-alone WWW server. Although it
can be used in that mode, they are many other full featured servers available
that do that job very well.  Jetty is primarily intended to be embedded in
Java applications, either to provide a primarary or management interface
over HTTP. Just as java is an ideal language for developing cross platform
distributed applications, embedded HTTP with generated HTML are an ideal
way of providing a distributed cross platform user interfaces.

Jetty is a HTTP Server written in Java.  It is an ideal
platform for server-side development of Dynamic WWW services or as a basis
for WWW enabling Java applications.
Quoting from Javasofts <A HREF=http://www.javasoft.com/products/java-server/servlets/index.html>
Java Servlet API White Paper</A>:
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>
Java is a great platform for writing the server side of your web-based application. The same features which make Java a better platform
for writing client applications make it better for writing servers. Your server applications will benefit from its type safety and other rapid
development features even more than your client applications did, because multi-threading support is built into the Java platform. 
<P>
Java makes it easy to develop and deploy all parts of a professional, maintainable distributed system application. The Servlet API
provides you the fastest way to start using Java Server technology in your networked applications. You can start with applications which
involve clients and a single server, and gradually create multi-tier enterprise applications which integrate the power and flexibility of Java
throughout your existing network ... because Java Servlets run on the software and hardware you've already installed. 
</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
Jetty provides these benefits of Java in a HTTP/HTML enabled platform, which
can be used as the basis for new WWW services or to WWW enable existing
applications.

<A NAME="Software Engineering"></A>
<P><B>Software Engineering</B></BR>  
Traditional WWW development using authored HTML pages is not a scalable
approach for the development of significant WWW sites, nor does CGI access
provide and adequate mechanism for accessing dynamic state of a running
application. The authored HTML plus CGI approach creates configuration and
maintenance problems for even small sites.
<P>
Using the highly productive Java programming environment for WWW
server development allows object oriented software engineering
techniques to be applied to:<UL>
  <LI>Extraction of common elements for re-use within the site and
       potentially between sites.
  <LI>Create a site architecture that supports both generalized behavior and
       specialized functionality.
  <LI>Implment and enforce the standards and conventions of a sites Look
       and Feel.
  <LI>Creation of site specific server-side infrastructure for site
       development and maintenance by less skilled developers.
  <LI>Configuration control.
  <LI>Build, Testing and release strategies.
</UL>
<P>
Bundled with Jetty are several utility packages which form a good basis
for a Java software infrastructure for WWW development, including:
<UL>
  <LI>Code debugging, asserts, warnings and event logging.
  <LI>Test harness for automated regression testing.
  <LI>FTP client package
  <LI>JDBC wrappers.
  <LI>HTML Generation.
</UL> 
<A NAME="Flexible Deployment"></A>
<P><B>Flexible Deployment</B></BR>       
Jetty has been designed to highly configurable and flexible. It can be used
as a stand-alone server running application servlets or it can be embedded
in java application to provide a WWW interface to the services that they
provide.
<p>With embeded Jetty development, a HTTP server can be instantiated in 
every Java virtual machine (JVM) of a distributed system, even if it is only
to present a management interface of application status and statistics.
<p>The many extensible features of Jetty are provided via handlers,
that only need to be loaded if they are configured to be used. Thus a
minimal Jetty installation consumes very few system resources.
<A NAME="Standard HTTP File serving"></A>
<P><B>Standard HTTP File serving</B><BR>
Jetty can serve standard files like most other HTTP servers and supports:
<UL>
  <LI>File name extension used to map to MIME type.
  <LI>Default index files for directories.
  <LI>Directory listings
  <LI>Multiple directory hierarchies.
</UL>
<A NAME="Serving Servlets"></A>
<P><B>Serving Servlets</B><BR>
Jetty supports the javax.servlet.* API defined by JavaSoft:
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>
Servlets are protocol- and platform-independent server side components,
written in Java, which dynamically extend Java-enabled
servers. They provide a general framework for services built using the
request-response paradigm. </I> [Javasofts Java Servlet API White Paper]
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>

<A NAME="Extensible Request Handlers"></A>
<P><B>Extensible Request Handlers</B><BR>
In addition to servlets, Jetty also supports extensible Http Handlers.
A HttpHandler is syntactically similar to a servlet, but semantically they
are more similar to the filter concept of NCSA's JigSaw Java HttpServer.
<P>
When a HTTP request is received, the request path and server configuration
are used to select a stack of HttpHandler instances. The request
and response are passed to each handler in the stack until the
request is handled.  HttpHandlers may choose to ignore, modify or handle a
request given to them. They also may choose to ignore, generate or modify
the response to a request.
<p>
The ability of a HttpHandler to modify the request and responses passed
to them and for handlers to be stacked, make them a much more flexible
and powerful paradigm than chaining servlets.
File serving and the Jetty servlet environment are implemented as a
HttpHandlers. 
<p>
Current Handlers provided with Jetty include:<UL>
  <LI>Log Handler
  <LI>Parameter Handler
  <LI>Session Handler
  <LI>Authentication handler
  <LI>Translate Handler
  <LI>Filter Handler
  <LI>Servlet Handler
  <LI>File Handler
  <LI>Forward Handler
  <LI>Proxy Handler
  <LI>NotFound Handler
</UL>
Possible future handlers include:<UL>
  <LI>Cache request handler
  <LI>Random content handler
  <LI>Statistics collection handler
</UL>


<A NAME="Extensible Exception Handlers"></A>
<P><B>Extensible Exception Handlers</B><BR>
Jetty has an extensible exception handler mechanism similar to the
HttpHandler mechanism.  If a handler or servlet throws an exception,
then the request path and server configuration is used to select
a stack of exception handlers.  The exception is passed to each handler
in turn, until one of them handles it.
<p>
This allows a WWW application to install better catch all handling of
errors that give clients application specific apologies rather than
internal error messages and stack traces.


<A NAME="HTML Generation"></A>
<P><B>HTML Generation</B><BR>
While HTML is a simple language to learn and write, it can be also be
very tedious, contrived and error prone.  Furthermore, authored HTML
is a static resource and cannot be customized to each request or updated
from a database.
<P>
Jetty comes with a rich HTML generation package that can be used on its
own, with another servlet server or in Jetty servlets. Supported for
templated look and feel is a key element of this package.


<A NAME="Server Side Includes"></A>
<P><B>Server Side Includes</B><BR>
HTML Generation requires programming skills, which may not always be
available.  Jetty has a number of server side inclusion mechanisms that
allow authored HTML to be combined with dynamic content.  The contents of
a file or even results from another HTTP request can be included (embedded)
in a page as it is generated or by filtering a response stream.  The
combination of these techniques allows a "best of both worlds" solution to
be developed.


<A NAME="Server Push Support"></A>
<P><B>Server Push Support</B><BR>
Because Jetty assigns each request it own Thread, it is a simple matter
for that thread to continue execution and  send updates
back to the browser, continually or in response to some asynchronous
condition.
<p>Combined with Multi-part MIME encoding it is possible for the server
to update the entire browser frame when ever it chooses.


<A NAME="Client Session Tracking"></A>
<P><B>Client Session Tracking</B><BR>
Jetty uses it's handler architecture and cookie support to
provide user session and browser tracking.  Each browser that hits
a Jetty site is assigned a permanent browser Id. Every client session is
also assigned an Id and session data may be queried, set or modified to
allow communication and maintain state between multiple requests from the
same same session.


<A NAME="Response Filtering"></A>
<P><B>Response Filtering</B><BR>
Jetty provides a mechanism to allow filters to be conditionally inserted
into the output stream of a response to a request.  These filters, which
are activated on content type, allow pages arbitrary changes to be made to
responses that may have been generated, retrieved from a file or even
fetched from another server.
<p>
Jetty provides a filter for HTML which can use reflection to execute
Java method calls embedded in specially formatted HTML comments.
This is allows dynamic content to be added to pages that have been
statically authored or generated elsewhere.
Support is provided to use this mechanism for server side includes and
URL embedding.
<P>
Other potential uses for filters include:<UL>
  <LI>Server-side includes.
  <LI>Encryption and/or authentication with digital signatures.
  <LI>Modification of link URLs for link tracking or page relocation.
  <LI>Embedding application specific dynamic content in authored HTML pages.
  <LI>Translation of formats not supported by a browser eg. JPG to GIF or
       EBCDIC to ASCII.
</UL>


<A NAME="Request Forwarding"></A>
<P><B>Request Forwarding</B><BR>
When developing a WWW site, it often is desirable to combine the
features of several different servers.  Jetty can forward requests that
it receives to another WWW server and pass the response it back as the
response to the original request.
<P>
While similar to a redirect, forwarding offers several key benefits:<UL>
  <LI>The response is passed back through Jetty, so it may be filtered
       or modified in other ways.
  <LI>The browser only sees a single request and response and two
       round trips are not required.
  <LI>The client does not need to access the destination server, so it
       may be placed behind a firewall on a secure network. Jetty thus
       can act as a HTTP firewall.
</UL>


<A NAME="Proxy Handling"></A>
<P><B>Proxy Handling</B><BR>
The ProxyHandler implementation of HTTP Handler, allows Jetty to be
configured as a proxy server for both FTP and HTTP requests. The results
of proxy requests are handled in the same fashion as any other request, so
the full features of Jetty may be applied to create intelligent proxy
services.


<A NAME="Flexible Configuration"></A>
<P><B>Flexible Configuration</B><BR>
Jetty has been design with flexible configuration options. It has been
decoupled from any utility libraries so that it does not require
it's own configuration files or system.
<p>
Instead, abstract configuration interfaces are used to
map the servers configuration needs to the appropriate mechanism for a
particular deployment.  Developers can implement these interfaces to
support their own configuration preferance. This may be configuration files
for a large stand alone server or a small hand coded class for a
server embedded in another Java application with a minimal set of handlers.


<A NAME="Legacy Integration"></A>
<P><B>Legacy Integration</B><BR>
Java is an ideal environment to access a exiting IT resources via JDBC,
CORBA or third party interface products.  Jetty allows these existing IT
resources to be represented as dynamic WWW services and forms an ideal middle
tier of a three tiered client-server solution.
<p>
Furthermore, The ability of Jetty to get responses from other HTTP servers and
modify or embed them in other pages, allows multiple services to be combined
into a single consistent WWW presence.
Thus existing systems can be used while migrating to a dynamic WWW approach.


<A NAME="Telephony and SmartCard Support"></A>
<P><B>Telephony and SmartCard Support</B><BR>
Jetty has been used as the basis for the products developed by
<A HREF="http://www.iswitched.com">Intelligent Switched Systems</A><BR>
<I>CallAccess</I> allows integration of WWW and Telephony services into a
single service environment.  Client calls can be handled by both
automatic IVR, WWW directed operators or a combination
of both.  WWW sites can be telephony enabled to call clients at their
request.<P>
<I>SmartAccess</I> provides a SmartCard authentication platform that
uses tones generated by the smartcard to identify a client over the phone
or over the WWW.  The system provides fraud prevention and
detection for accidental, malicious and systematic attacks.
