/**
 * Sends MIME-encoded data from the servlet to the client. The servlet
 * engine creates a <code>ServletResponse</code> object and passes it 
 * as an argument to the servlet's <code>service</code> method.
 *
 * <p>To send binary data in a MIME body response, use
 * the {@link ServletOutputStream} returned by {@link #getOutputStream}.
 * Likewise, to send text data, use the <code>PrintWriter</code> object 
 * returned by {@link #getWriter}. If you need to mix binary and text data,
 * for example, if you are creating a multipart response, use a
 * <code>ServletOutputStream</code> to write the multipart headers, and
 * then use the headers to build your own text bodies.
 *
 * <p>If you do not specify a character set for the MIME body response
 * with {@link #setContentType}, the servlet engine will select one
 * and modify the content accordingly. Call <code>setContentType</code>
 * before you call <code>getWriter</code> or <code>getOutputStream</code>.
 * 
 * <p>See the Internet RFCs such as RFC 2045 at 
 * <a href="http://info.internet.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc/files/rfc2045.txt">RFC 2045</a> 
 * for more information on MIME. Protocols such as SMTP
 * and HTTP define profiles of MIME, and those standards
 * are still evolving.
