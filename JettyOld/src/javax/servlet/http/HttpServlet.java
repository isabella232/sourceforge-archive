/**
 *
 * Provides an abstract class that you can subclass to create
 * an HTTP servlet, which receives requests from and
 * sends responses to a Web site. When you subclass 
 * <code>HttpServlet</code>, you must override at least 
 * one method, usually one of these:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li> <code>doGet</code>, if the servlet supports HTTP GET requests
 * <li> <code>doPost</code>, for HTTP POST requests
 * <li> <code>doPut</code>, for HTTP PUT requests
 * <li> <code>doDelete</code>, for HTTP DELETE requests
 * <li> <code>init</code> and <code>destroy</code>, 
 * which you override as a pair if you need to 
 * manage resources that are held for the life of the servlet
 * <li> <code>getServletInfo</code>, which the servlet uses to
 * provide information about itself 
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>You usually will not override the <code>service</code>
 * method. <code>service</code> handles standard HTTP
 * requests by dispatching them to the handler methods
 * for each HTTP request type (the <code>do</code><i>xxx</i>
 * methods listed above).
 *
 * <p>Likewise, you usually will not override the 
 * <code>doOptions</code> and <code>doTrace</code> methods.
 * The <code>service</code> method supports HTTP 1.1
 * TRACE and OPTIONS requests by dispatching them to
 * <code>doTrace</code> and <code>doOptions</code>.
 * 
 * <p>Servlets typically run on multithreaded servers,
 * so you must write your servlet to handle concurrent
 * requests and synchronize access to shared resources.
 * Shared resources include in-memory data such as
 * instance or class variables and external objects
 * such as files, database connections, and network 
 * connections.
 * See the
 * <a href="http://java.sun.com/Series/Tutorial/java/threads/multithreaded.html">
 * Java Tutorial on Multithreaded Programming</a> for more
 * information on handling multiple threads in a Java program.

    /**
     *
     * Receives an HTTP GET request from the protected
     * <code>service</code> method and handles the request. 
     * The GET method allows a client to read information
     * from the Web server, passing a query string appended
     * to an URL to tell the server what information
     * to return.
     *
     * <p>Overriding this method to support a GET request also
     * automatically supports an HTTP HEAD request. A HEAD
     * request is a GET request that returns no body in the
     * response, only the request header fields.
     *
     * <p>If you override this method, you should read data from
     * the request, set entity headers in the response, 
     * access the writer or output stream object, and finally,
     * write the response data. When you set headers, be
     * sure to include content type and encoding. If you use
     * a <code>PrintWriter</code> object to return the response,
     * you must set the content type before you access the
     * <code>PrintWriter</code> object.
     *
     * <p>The servlet engine must write the headers before
     * the response data, because the headers can be flushed
     * at any time after the data is written.
     *
     * <p>If you can set the Content-Length header (with the
     * {@link javax.servlet.ServletResponse.#contentType} method),
     * the servlet
     * can use a persistent connection to return its response
     * to the client, improving performance dramatically.
     * If you cannot set Content-Length, you can sometimes avoid
     * the performance penalty if the response fits in an internal
     * buffer.
     * 
     * <p>The GET method should be safe, that is, without
     * any side effects for which users are held responsible.
     * For example, most form queries have no side effects.
     * If a client request is intended to change stored data,
     * the request should use some other HTTP method.
     *
     * <p>The GET method should also be idempotent, meaning
     * that it can be safely repeated. Sometimes making a
     * method safe also makes it idempotent. For example, 
     * repeating queries is both safe and idempotent, but
     * buying a product online or modifying data is neither
     * safe nor idempotent. 
     *
     * <p>If the request is incorrectly formatted, <code>doGet</code>
     * returns an HTTP BAD_REQUEST message.
