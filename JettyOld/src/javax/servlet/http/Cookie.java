/**
 *
 * Creates a cookie, a small amount of information sent by a servlet to 
 * a Web browser, saved by the browser, and later sent back to the server 
 * when the client accesses the same Web page. A cookie's value can uniquely 
 * identify a client, so cookies are commonly used for session management.
 * 
 * <p>A cookie has a name, a single value, and optional attributes
 * such as a comment, path and domain qualifiers, a maximum age, and a
 * version number. Some Web browsers have bugs in how they handle the 
 * attributes, so use them sparingly to improve the interoperability 
 * of your servlets.
 *
 * <p>The servlet sends cookies to the browser by using the
 * {@link HttpServletResponse.addCookie} method, which adds
 * fields to HTTP response headers to send cookies to the 
 * browser, one at a time. The browser is expected to 
 * support 20 cookies for each Web server, of at least 4 KB each.
 * 
 * <p>The browser returns cookies to the servlet by adding 
 * fields to HTTP request headers. You can retrieve all of the cookies
 * in a request by using the {@link HttpServletRequest.getCookies} method.
 * Several cookies might have the same name but different path attributes.
 * 
 * <p>Cookies affect the caching of the Web pages that use them. 
 * HTTP 1.0 does not cache pages that use cookies created with
 * this class. This class does not support the cache control
 * defined with HTTP 1.1.
 *
 * <p>This class both the Version 0 (by Netscape) and Version 1 
 * (by RFC 2109) cookie specifications. By default, cookies are
 * created using Version 0 to ensure the best interoperability.
