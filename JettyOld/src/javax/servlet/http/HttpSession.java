/**
 *
 * Provides a way to identify a user across more than one page
 * request or visit to a Web site.
 *
 * <p>The servlet engine uses this interface to create a session
 * between an HTTP client and an HTTP server. The session persists
 * for a specified time period, across more than one connection or
 * page request from the user. A session usually corresponds to one 
 * user, who may visit a site many times. The server can maintain a 
 * session either by using cookies or by rewriting URLs.
 *
 * <p>This interface allows servlets to 
 * <ul>
 * <li>View and manipulate information about a session, such as
 * the session identifier, creation time, or context
 * <li>Bind objects to sessions, allowing you to use an
 * online shopping cart
 * to hold data that persists across multiple user connections
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p> <code>HttpSession</code> defines methods that
 * store these types of data:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Standard session properties, such as a session identifier
 * or session context
 * <li>Data that the application provides, accessed using this
 * interface and stored using a dictionary-like interface
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The servlet can obtain data from the session, modify it,
 * and return it to the session, as this example shows:
 *
 * <code>
 * //Get the session object - "request" represents the HTTP servlet request
 * HttpSession session = request.getSession(true);
 *
 * //Get the session data value - an Integer object is read from 
 * //the session, incremented, then written back to the session.
 * //sessiontest.counter identifies values in the session
 * Integer ival = (Integer) session.getValue("sessiontest.counter");
 * if (ival==null) 
 *    ival = new Integer(1);
 * else 
 *   ival = new Integer(ival.intValue() + 1);
 * session.putValue("sessiontest.counter", ival);
 * </code>
 *
 * <p>When an application stores an object in or removes it from a
 * session, the session checks whether the object implements
 * {@link HttpSessionBindingListener}. If it does, 
 * the servlet notifies the object that it has been bound to or unbound 
 * from the session.
 * 
 * <p>An HTTP session represents the server's view of the session.
 * The server considers a session new under any of these conditions:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The client does not yet know about the session
 * <li>The session has not yet begun
 * <li>The client chooses not to join the session, for example,
 * if the server supports only cookies and the client rejects the
 * cookies the server sends
 * </ul>
 * When the session is new, the {@link #isNew} method 
 * returns <code>true</code>.
 *
 * <p>You must write your servlet to handle cases in which
 * the client has not joined a session. The following code
 * example calls <code>isNew</code> to determine whether
 * a session is new. If it is, the server requires the client
 * to start a session by directing the client to a welcome
 * page which the user must enter before gaining access to
 * other pages on the site.
 *
 * <code>
 * //Get the session object - "request" represents the HTTP servlet request
 * HttpSession session = request.getSession(true);
 *
 * //insist that the client starts a session
 * //before access to data is allowed
 * //"response" represents the HTTP servlet response
 * if (session.isNew()) {
 *   response.sendRedirect (welcomeURL);
 * }
 * </code>
