Building
---------

Look in build.sh.
Set up JETTY_HOME and JBOSS_HOME accordingly.
./build.sh

(default target tests with standalone Jetty)

Testing
--------

You can currently build and test the distributable session
implementation with either Jetty or JBoss.


With Jetty
-----------

Ant will automatically start 2 Jetty instances (on different ports) on
your local box, passing configurations to each which will deploy the
server-side test app. It will then call the client-side test app and
run through a series of tests.


With JBoss
-----------

You need to have two JBoss 'all' instances running on two different
boxes (currently hardwired). Ant will deploy the server-side test app
to both instances, use the client-side test app to test them and then
undeploy the server-side test app.
