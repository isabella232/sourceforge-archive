# Sections
# This describes the different type of doco the servlet will catalogue. These
# are fairly arbitrary. At least 1 is required. The name of the section
# (eg. jd) is used to indicate the paths to search for under the
# individual package specifications later. The value here is the display name
# used on the pages for that type of documentation.

# Package Specs.
# Each package spec can have the following fields:
#   paths: (required) Where to look for the package. The directory with the
# name of the package will be searched for under this directory.
#   versioning: The number of intermediate directories underneath the package
# directory before doco should be searched for. This is to handle where a
# package will have an arbitrary number of directories under itself for
# multiple versions of the package. E.g. In package jdk, in /usr/local (where
# paths=/usr/local) there may be sol2/1.2.2 and linux/1.2.2, thus versioning
# should be set to 2. The servlet assumes that the last directory is the
# major version directory (i.e the above is assumed, rather than 1.2.2/linux
# and 1.2.2/sol2). If set to 0, it is assumed there is only 1 installation.
#   description: The display name describing the package (don't make it too
# long, it clutters the display)
#   ignore: "versioning" intermediary directories that should be ignored and
# passed over. Use this to handle cases where you may have symlinks pointing
# to the one version but only want it to show up under 1 name.
# 
# In addition, packages must specify the path(s) to search for documents of
# the type(s) specified in "sections" above; Not all sections need to be
# specified, but at least 1 is a good idea, otherwise the package will have
# no doco links. E.g. If you specified "sections.adoc: Doc Type A" then
# packages with doco of that type should have a field called "adoc" with the
# path to the Doc Type A file or directory (within a single version). Since
# different versions of a package might have different paths to their
# documentation, you can specify a list of paths. Since many packages will
# have similar paths, versioning, and doc paths, it is a good idea to use
# defaults such as pkgs.*.paths. Don't use defaults like "*.paths" or paths
# will show up as a doco type section!
